    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib giving
      together with radiation therapy and temozolomide and to see how well it works in treating
      younger patients newly diagnosed with diffuse pontine gliomas. Veliparib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy
      uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving veliparib together with radiation therapy
      and temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximum-tolerated dose or recommended Phase II dose of veliparib
      (ABT-888) which can be safely administered concurrently with radiation therapy, followed by
      maintenance therapy with ABT-888 and temozolomide (TMZ), in patients with newly diagnosed
      diffuse pontine gliomas (DIPG). (Phase I) II. To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      ABT-888 during ABT-888 and radiation therapy. (Phase I) III. To study the feasibility of
      intra-patient dose escalation of TMZ during maintenance therapy with ABT-888 and TMZ. (Phase
      I) IV. To describe the toxicities associated with administering ABT-888 and radiation
      therapy, followed by ABT-888 and TMZ, in patients with newly diagnosed DIPG. (Phase I) V. To
      estimate the proportion of newly diagnosed DIPG patients treated on protocol that are
      determined to have experienced pseudoprogression. (Phase I) VI. To estimate the overall
      survival distribution for newly diagnosed patients with DIPG treated with the combination of
      ABT-888 and radiation therapy, followed by ABT-888 and TMZ, and compare to PBTC historical
      controls. (Phase II) VII. To study the feasibility of intra-patient dose escalation of TMZ
      during maintenance therapy with ABT-888 and TMZ. (Phase II) VIII. To estimate the proportion
      of newly diagnosed DIPG patients treated on protocol that are determined to have experienced
      pseudoprogression. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) distribution and to summarize the best
      tumor responses observed prior to progression or recurrence.

      II. To explore the plasma PK of ABT-888 during ABT-888 and radiation therapy. III. To
      explore peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) polymerase (PARP) activity before and after
      treatment with ABT-888.

      IV. To explore quantifying non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity or Î³-H2AX levels (as
      surrogate markers of unrepaired DSBs) in PBMC before and after treatment with ABT-888.

      V. To explore quantifying PARP activity and DNA-repair protein levels in biopsied atypical
      pontine gliomas, if available.

      VI. To explore associations of molecular parameters from secondary aims III, IV, and V with
      PFS and overall survival (OS) after conclusion of clinical trial.

      VII. To explore the quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) measures of relative cerebral blood
      volume (rCBV), vascular permeability (Ktrans, vp, and ve values), and apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC) within the first six months of initiating protocol treatment to correlate
      with disease outcome and determine whether such metrics differentiate patients with
      pseudoprogression from those with true early progressive disease.

      VIII. To explore the potential utility of urine biomarkers as a novel, non-invasive method
      of detecting and tracking changes in the status of pediatric brain stem gliomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, phase I study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.

      DOSE-ESCALATION: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for
      6-7 weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 3-4 weeks later, patients receive veliparib PO BID on days
      1-5 and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 3
      years.
