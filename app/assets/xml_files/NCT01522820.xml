    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best schedule of vaccine therapy when given
      together with or without sirolimus in treating patients with NY-ESO-1 expressing solid
      tumors. Biological therapies, such as sirolimus, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from a person's white blood
      cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill
      tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Infusing the vaccine directly into a lymph node may cause
      a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. Is not yet known whether vaccine
      therapy is more effective when given with or without sirolimus in treating solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety of DC205-NY-ESO-1 vaccine (DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine)
      with and without sirolimus. Toxicity as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity: peripheral blood NY-ESO-1
      specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ T-cells; peripheral blood NY-ESO-1
      specific antibodies; peripheral blood frequency of CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+
      regulatory T-cells.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore time to disease progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard collection of peripheral white blood cells via leukapheresis over
      90-240 minutes for vaccine preparation. Patients are assigned sequentially to Cohorts 1a-1d.

      COHORT 1a: Patients receive intranodal DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine on days 1,
      29, 57, and 113.

      COHORT 1b: Patients receive DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine as in Cohort 1a and
      sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-14, 29-42, and 57-70.

      COHORT 1c: Patients receive DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine as in Cohort 1a and
      sirolimus PO on days 15-28, 43-56, and 71-84.

      COHORT 1d: Patients receive DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine as in Cohort 1a and
      sirolimus PO on days 1-84.

      COHORT 2: Patients receive treatment as in the Cohort (1a-1d) that is determined to be safe
      and produces optimal immunological effects.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, and 6 and 12
      months.
