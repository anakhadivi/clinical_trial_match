    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients ciliopathies. People with ciliopathies develop fibrocystic
      disease of the kidneys and liver, retinal degeneration, obesity, structural and functional
      defects of the central nervous system and the eyes, abnormal bone growth, abnormal sidedness
      of internal organs and polydactyly. The goal of the study is to better understand the
      medical complications of these disorders and identify characteristics that can help in the
      design of new treatments....

    <textblock>
      Human diseases caused by defects of the primary cilium (ciliopathies) are a group of
      distinct disorders with overlapping features. Clinical features of ciliopathies include
      fibrocystic disease of the kidneys and liver, retinal degeneration, obesity, structural and
      functional defects of the central nervous system and the eyes, abnormal bone growth,
      abnormal sidedness of internal organs and polydactyly. Human ciliopathies characterized by
      variable combinations of these features include autosomal recessive (ARPKD) and dominant
      (ADPKD) polycystic kidney diseases, nephronophthisis (NPHP), Joubert syndrome and related
      disorders (JSRD), Bardet-Biedl (BBS), Meckel-Gruber (MKS), Oral-Facial-Digital-type 1
      (OFD1), and Alstrom syndromes (AS) and skeletal disorders such as Jeune syndrome (JS) and
      cleidocranial dysplasia. ARPKD, the most common pediatric ciliopathy, is characterized by
      cystic degeneration of the kidneys and congenital hepatic fibrosis of the liver. JSRD are a
      heterogenous group of syndromes characterized by a distinctive cerebellar and brainstem
      malformation (molar tooth sign), intellectual disability, abnormal eye movements, and
      abnormal respiratory pattern in infancy. Other common features seen in subsets of JSRD
      patients include, fibrocystic renal disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis, retinal
      degeneration, retinal colobomas, occipital encephalocele, and polydactyly. AS and BBS are
      ciliopathies characterized by obesity and retinal degeneration and hepatorenal disease in
      most cases. BBS patients also exhibit postaxial polydactyly, cognitive impairment, male
      hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and female genitourinary malformations. Additional features
      in AS include metabolic syndrome associated with insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia,
      cardiomyopathy and sensorineural deafness. OFD-I is characterized by polycystic kidney
      disease and oral, digital and brain anomalies including cerebellar hypoplasia with or
      without Dandy- Walker malformation. JS is a skeletal ciliopathy characterized by small
      thorax, short- limbed short stature, fibrocystic renal disease and retinal degeneration. The
      frequency and characteristics and natural history of specific organ/system disease in
      ciliopathies are either unknown or poorly defined, mostly because of the limited data
      available from retrospective reports of small numbers of patients.

      In this protocol, we will evaluate up to 500 children and adults with various ciliopathies
      with special emphasis on delineating the characteristics of individual organ system
      involvement including kidney, liver, eye, central nervous system and bone disease and
      metabolic derangements associated with obesity/insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome. We
      will perform mutation analysis of the related ciliopathy genes as needed. Routine outpatient
      evaluations will last 4-5 days and follow up visits will occur approximately every 1-2
      years. This protocol will provide longitudinal information regarding progression of
      individual organ system disease in a large cohort of ciliopathy patients, and will elucidate
      genotype-phenotype correlations. The protocol will also allow the investigators to acquire
      sufficient expertise in relatively common ciliopathies such as ARPKD, JSRD and AS to design
      therapeutic interventions for specific organ diseases in the future.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        This protocol will enroll children and adults who carry a clinical diagnosis of ARPKD,
        CHF, JSRD, BBS, OFD or AS and who has either PKD/NP spectrum of changes in the kidneys or
        CHF/Caroli's syndrome of the liver.  This might rarely include adults who are unable to
        give informed consent.

        Among patients who have received a kidney or liver allograft, those with stable graft
        function and without severe transplant-related complications are eligible for enrollment.
        Patients and their parents/legal guardians must be willing to come to the NIH Clinical
        Center for admission annually.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Infants under 6 months of age.

        Medically fragile patients who require frequent hospitalizations due to complications of
        end-stage renal disease (uncontrolled hypertension, severe electrolyte imbalances) or
        hepatic disease (current variceal bleeding, overt encephalopathy, intractable recurrent
        cholangitis).
