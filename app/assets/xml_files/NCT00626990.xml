      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation
      therapy together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether
      giving temozolomide during and/or after radiation therapy is more effective than radiation
      therapy alone in treating anaplastic glioma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving temozolomide during and/or after
      radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to radiation therapy alone in treating
      patients with anaplastic glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess whether concurrent radiotherapy with daily temozolomide improves overall
           survival as compared to no daily temozolomide in patients with non-1p/19q deleted
           anaplastic glioma.

        -  To assess whether adjuvant temozolomide improves survival as compared to no adjuvant
           temozolomide in patients with non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma.

      Secondary

        -  To assess whether concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide prolongs progression-free
           survival and neurological deterioration-free survival in patients with non-1p/19q
           deleted anaplastic glioma.

        -  To assess the safety of concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide in patients with
           non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma, including late effects on cognition.

        -  To assess the impact of concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide on the quality of life of
           patients with non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution, WHO
      performance status (0 vs &gt; 0), age (≤ 50 vs &gt; 50), presence of 1p LOH only (yes vs no),
      presence of oligodendroglial elements (yes vs no), and O6-methylguanine-DNA
      methyltransferase promoter methylation status (methylated vs unmethylated vs indeterminate).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy* once daily, 5 days a week, for 6.5 weeks (total
           of 33 fractions).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy* once daily, 5 days a week and receive oral
           temozolomide once daily for 6.5 weeks (total of 33 fractions of radiotherapy).

        -  Arm III: Patients undergo radiotherapy* once daily, 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks (total
           of 33 fractions). Beginning 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive
           adjuvant oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment with adjuvant temozolomide
           repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses.

        -  Arm IV: Patients undergo radiotherapy* once daily, 5 days a week and receive oral
           temozolomide once daily for 6.5 weeks (total of 33 fractions of radiotherapy).
           Beginning 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive adjuvant oral
           temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment with adjuvant temozolomide repeats every
           28 days for up to 12 courses.

      NOTE: *Patients must begin radiotherapy within 8 days after randomization and within 7 weeks
      after surgery.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires, including QLQ-C30 version 3, BCM20, and
      the Mini Mental Status Exam at baseline, 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, and
      then every 3 months for 5 years.

      Tissue samples are collected at baseline for histology review, 1p/19q analysis, methylation
      status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter, and isocitrate dehydrogenase
      mutation analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
