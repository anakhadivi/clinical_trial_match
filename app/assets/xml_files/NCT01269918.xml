      This will be a randomized blinded clinical trial.  Patients will be randomized to receive
      either a remifentanil or dexmedetomidine infusion for general anesthesia. The anesthesia
      team will know the result of randomization at induction.  Data will be gathered by research
      personnel who will be blinded to the anesthetic method used.  Patients will be blinded to
      the anesthetic they receive till they are discharged from the PACU when they will have the
      option to be unblinded. The Data Safety and -Toxicity Committee will review all serious
      adverse events and toxicity reports as well as annual reviews.

    <textblock>
      Anesthesia for craniotomy presents a unique challenge to the anesthesiologist. Anesthesia
      for neurosurgical procedures should  provide optimal surgical conditions while maintaining
      appropriate cerebral oxygen supply and stable systemic hemodynamics. (1)  It is  important
      to prevent patient response to noxious stimuli during the procedure like pinning, drilling
      of the bone, opening and manipulation of the dura etc., avoid coughing and bucking during
      surgery and during extubation thus necessitating a deeper level of anesthesia and analgesia.
       At the same time it is desirable to have the patient fully awake toward the end of the
      surgery in order to facilitate neurologic evaluation. Management of the above presents a
      challenge during induction, maintenance and extubation and also during multiple critical
      stages of surgery  Fear of the side effects of analgesic drugs frequently leads to the
      under-treatment of post-craniotomy pain. (2) Nevertheless, this pain continues to be
      commonly observed, is frequently severe, and, if unrelieved, may cause distress for the
      neurosurgical patient and serious complications for the operative brain. (2) There is a need
      for larger trials to delineate safety and efficacy of analgesic therapies with a focus on
      short- and long-term outcomes.
