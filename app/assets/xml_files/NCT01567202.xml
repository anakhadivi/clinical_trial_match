    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study in a single center to determine the efficacy of autologous
      dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with autogeneic glioma stem-like cells (A2B5+) administered as
      a vaccination in adults with glioblastoma multiforme (primary or secondary).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment (surgery +radiation +chemotherapy), median
      survival for patients with newly diagnosed brain glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is about one
      year, for recurrent GBM is about 4 months. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel
      treatment strategy for glioma with improving patient survival. Usually, processed tumor
      antigens from the patient's own tumor or a peptide vaccine is capable of producing an
      anti-glioma response. Our previous experiment revealed that the CD133+ tumor stem-like cells
      associated antigens could elicit highly intensive immune response against human malignant
      glioma [1], and in phase I study, we have confirmed that DC vaccine loaded with glioma
      stem-like cells associated antigens against malignant glioma in recurrent patients was of
      safety [2].

      Autologous DCs will be obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each
      patient. Stem-like cells associated antigens (SAA) will be prepared with glioma stem-like
      cells that are harvested from patients with GBM and primary cultured and sorted
      flowcytometrically and then irradiated. Approximately 4 weeks will be required for vaccine
      production and the first vaccine administration. Each patient will receive an injection of
      DCs at his/her assigned dose once every week during the first 6 week. The dose of DCs is
      defined as 8~10×10^6.

      Clinical trials that utilize DCs for immunotherapy have demonstrated significant survival
      benefit for patients who exhibit robust immune responses against tumor cells. Unfortunately,
      at the present time the majority of clinical trials were in phase I that illustrated the
      safety. The efficacy of DCs against glioblastoma is still lack of sufficient randomized
      phase II study. According to our previous phase I study, here we designed this clinical
      trial in a triple-blind randomized manner to validate the efficacy of DCs vaccination.
