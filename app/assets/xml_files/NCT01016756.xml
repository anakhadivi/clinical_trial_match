      1. PHACE syndrome(OMIM database number 606519) is the association of a vascular birthmark
           (hemangioma) on the face along with one or more of the following conditions: congenital
           heart defects, congenital anomalies of the cerebral arteries,brain, eyes, or sternum.

        2. A research study is currently being conducted at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)
           to investigate if there is an inherited cause of PHACE syndrome.

        3. We are hoping that this study will lead to a better understanding of how and why
           children develop PHACE syndrome.

      If you and your child agree to participate in this study, the following will happen:

        1. The principal investigator at MCW, or her appointed representative, will review the
           study protocol and consent form with you and answer any questions- this can be done
           over the phone.

        2. If you choose to participate, the investigator will obtain informed consent for study
           participation, consent to obtain medical records, and a small amount of logistical
           information such as address and phone number.

        3. Subjects and parents will have a blood draw which can be done a local laboratory.

        4. If the subject undergoes surgery for another reason and there is tissue which would
           otherwise be discarded, we may ask to receive this sample for research purposes.

        5. We will request completion of surveys about the individual's  medical history as it
           relates to this condition.

        6. The purpose of this study is to promote the understanding of the inheritance of
           hemangiomas associated with brain, eye and heart anomalies.  The DNA obtained from
           participants are stored in a DNA repository and genetic data bank for current and
           future research projects related to their genetic disorders.  The DNA specimens will be
           used to map disease-related genes. The principal investigator uses her discretion to
           decide which investigators will have access to this resource.  The analysis of the
           specimens will vary depending on the investigator and his/her specific protocol.
