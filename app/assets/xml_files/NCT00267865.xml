      This study will investigate the use of chemotherapy plus highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) in patients with AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma. None of the drugs used
      in this study are experimental, but chemotherapy plus HAART has not been established as a
      standard treatment in patients with AIDS. The chemotherapy regimen used in this study (see
      below) was chosen because it may be less toxic to immune cells called T-lymphocytes than
      most drug treatments for lymphoma.

      People with AIDS 18 and older and have primary brain lymphoma may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, MRI, CT and
      PET scans, cerebrospinal fluid studies, brain biopsy at tumor sites, if possible,
      electrocardiogram and blood tests.

      Participants undergo six 2-week &quot;induction treatment&quot; cycles of HAART plus chemotherapy with
      methotrexate, rituximab and leucovorin, followed by two 4-week &quot;consolidation&quot; treatment
      cycles using HAART, methotrexate and leucovorin, and then HAART alone. Rituximab is given by
      intravenous (IV, through a vein) day 1 of each cycle. Also on day 1 IV fluids are given to
      lower acidity in the urine to protect the kidneys from the methotrexate. On day 2,
      methotrexate is infused through a vein over 4 hours. Starting 24 hours after initiation of
      the methotrexate infusion, leucovorin is given every 3 to 6 hours (first IV and then
      possibly by mouth) until the drug decreases to  a target level in the blood. HAART is begun
      as soon as possible. The specific HAART regimen for each patient is determined individually.
      All patients are hospitalized the first week of every 2-week treatment cycle for safety
      monitoring. In addition to HAART and chemotherapy, patients undergo the following tests and
      procedures:

        -  Intellectual functioning: Before starting treatment, patients are tested for their
           ability to understand basic concepts and coordination in order to be able to evaluate
           how the brain lymphoma affects thinking and concentration. After the lymphoma appears
           to have resolved, more formal and intensive tests are done. The intensive tests are
           repeated each year, and shorter, interim tests are done about every 6 months. Also, a
           specialist periodically monitors patients' understanding of HAART and the importance of
           this therapy.

        -  Blood tests: Blood is drawn every day during hospitalizations to measure methotrexate
           levels and to evaluate kidney and liver function and blood counts. Blood is also drawn
           before starting therapy, when the lymphoma disappears, 6 months after completing
           treatment, and any time it appears that the lymphoma may have recurred to test for
           Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a virus that is almost always present in AIDS-related primary
           brain lymphoma.

        -  Imaging tests: Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission
           tomography (PET) scans periodically to monitor the effects of treatment on the
           lymphoma. MRI scans are done after the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th treatments, then every 2
           months for three times, every 3 months for six times, every 6 months for four times,
           and then every year for 5 years, or sooner if there is a concern about the brain. PET
           scans are done after the first cycle, after the MRI suggests the lymphoma is gone, and
           then yearly.

        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This test is done to look for EBV in the cerebrospinal
           fluid (CSF). Under local anesthetic, a needle is inserted in the space between the
           bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord and a small
           amount of fluid is collected through the needle. This test is done at the same times as
           the blood tests for EBV.

        -  Eye examinations: Patients' eyes are examined periodically because brain lymphoma can
           sometimes spread to the eye and because some people with AIDS-related primary brain
           lymphoma are at risk of certain eye infections.

      Background: AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (AR-PCNSL) is an
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven lymphoproliferative process that typically results in death
      within a few months. Essentially all of the cases are immunoblastic CD20+ tumors, and occur
      once the CD4+ cells have fallen to below 50 cells/mm3 . Highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART) can result in immune reconstitution that decreases the risk of AR-PCNSL. However, a
      subset of HIV-infected patients still develop ARPCNSL, often because they are unaware that
      they are HIV infected, or they do not take HAART. Treatment options for such patients are
      limited. In the non-AIDS setting, chemotherapy has become the standard of care for primary
      central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and late neurocognitive decline consequent to
      radiotherapy can be avoided by such approaches. In the pre-HAART era, AR-PCNSL was generally
      treated with whole brain radiotherapy, however death due to recurrent lymphoma or to other
      AIDS complications occurred prior to the potential manifestations of late occurring
      radiation-related neurotoxicity. Radiation-sparing approaches have not been studied in
      AR-PCNSL in the HAART era, where advances in antiretroviral therapy have made curative
      intent chemotherapy feasible for most patients with HIV infection.

      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to estimate the fraction of patients with
      AR-PCNSL receiving experimental treatment consisting of HAART, combined with rituximab,
      high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin (R-HD-MTX) who are alive and without recurrent
      lymphoma or severe cognitive problems at two years. Secondary objectives include evaluation
      of safety and toxicities associated with R-HD-MTX plus HAART in patients with AR-PCNSL as
      well as estimating the complete response rate, progression-free, disease-free, overall
      survivals and long-term neurocognitive outcomes. Additionally, this study will assess
      overall survival, progression-free survival, and longterm neurocognitive outcomes in
      patients with AR-PCNSL in who HD-MTX is contraindicated and are therefore treated with
      radiation-sparing therapy consisting of dose-modified, dose-dense rituximab combined with
      HAART but no HD-MTX.

      Eligibility: HIV-infected, age 18 years or older, AR-PCSNL that has not previously been
      treated, and be able to give informed consent or have a durable power of attorney who can
      provide informed consent, HIV profile that makes them likely to respond to HAART. There are
      a number of other specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, in part to exclude patients who
      would be unlikely to tolerate the therapy.

      Design: Phase II pilot study investigating R-HD-MTX given with leucovorin rescue and HAART
      as a treatment for AR-PCNSL. Evaluation will include quantitative measurement of lymphocyte
      subsets, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of HIV and EBV viral loads (including
      both blood and cerebrospinal fluid in the case of EBV) to assess immune response and
      anti-viral effects. Tumor evaluation with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain
      fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET scans) will be used for
      staging and response assessment. Longitudinal neuropsychologic testing after complete
      responses are documented will serve to evaluate neurocognitive parameters post therapy.

      a separate cohort for additional secondary endpoints.
