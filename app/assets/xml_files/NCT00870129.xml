  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of these advanced MRI scans in predicting
      areas within a malignant glioma (brain tumor) that are at a high risk of recurring. If these
      advanced MRI scans are able to identify the cancerous part of the tumor, then radiation
      therapy can be targeted to those sites and possibly improve patient survival.

    <description>The advanced MRI studies will be obtained at the time of the routinely scheduled pre-RT planning MRI at approximately 3±2 weeks after surgery. The routine sequences obtained for the planning MRI are standard of care. The advanced MRI sequences will be additional.</description>

    <description>This is a nonrandomized study in which each patient will receive the standard clinical care (in the form of surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy), as per the treating physician. Surgical resection will be performed at the discretion of the treating Neurooncologist and/or Neurooncology Tumor Board. Advanced brain MRIs with the 2 (or, in some cases, 3) special sequences will be obtained at the time of the clinically scheduled contrast MRIs, which are usually obtained immediately prior to and 1 months±3 weeks after radiation therapy.</description>
