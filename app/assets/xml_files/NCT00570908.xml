      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of concurrent whole brain
      radiotherapy (WBRT) and capecitabine followed by combination capecitabine and sunitinib in
      treating patients with CNS metastases from breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system (CNS) metastases is the most common type of brain malignancy, and
      breast cancer is the second most common type of malignancy to cause CNS metastases. Although
      the incidence of CNS metastases is less common than bone or visceral metastases, it is
      associated with poorer prognosis and is relatively unresponsive to systemic therapies. The
      incidence of CNS metastases in breast cancer has been estimated as 1-16% in clinical series,
      with higher rates (18-30%) in autopsy series. Recently a trend towards increasing CNS
      relapse has been noted, up to 25-34%. This may be partly explained by the increasing use of
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), heightened awareness by patient or
      clinicians, or an alteration in the natural history of breast cancer with improvements in
      systemic therapies, resulting in a prolongation of survival. Therefore, with improvements in
      treatments, metastases are better controlled, resulting in the CNS becoming a sanctuary for
      residual disease. The treatment of CNS metastases in breast cancer remains challenging.
      Surgical resection of tumor will prolong survival only in patients with a single lesion and
      with well controlled systemic disease. For patients with multiple lesions, whole brain
      radiotherapy (WBRT) remains the backbone in the management of CNS metastases. Recently the
      use of stereotactic radiosurgery alone or in combination with WBRT has been explored.
      Although better local control was achieved with the combination therapy, minimal overall
      survival benefit was seen. This may be secondary to the competing risk of death from
      systemic (extra-CNS) progression. The use of systemic agents including chemotherapy and
      hormonal therapy has been generally disappointing. This is often attributed to the
      impermeability of the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers. Furthermore, P-glycoprotein
      (Pgp), a drug efflux pump encoded by the multidrug resistance gene, mdR1, is expressed in
      brain endothelial cells. Therefore, agents such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide,
      5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinorelbine, which are active against breast
      cancer, may either penetrate CNS poorly, or be transported out of the CNS environment.
      However, the blood brain barrier may be more leaky and permeable than previously thought in
      patients with CNS metastases, and these agents may achieve therapeutic concentrations in the
      CNS. As evidence for this, patients without prior exposure to agents such as
      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and doxorubicin, can have
      significant objective responses in the CNS metastases. Today, most patients would have
      received these agents in the adjuvant setting, thus emphasizing the importance of both
      chemo-sensitivity together with CNS penetration, in the treatment of CNS metastases.

      This is a single arm, open label, phase II drug study. This study will be conducted at the
      Breast Care Center at Baylor College of Medicine and its affiliated hospital, and at Ben
      Taub General Hospital in Houston. Patients who were diagnosed with CNS metastases (brain +/-
      leptomeningeal disease) will be identified prospectively. All eligible patients will receive
      capecitabine concurrently with WBRT followed by combination capecitabine with sunitinib.
      WBRT will be administered at 30 Gy in 10 fractions together with capecitabine to be given on
      the first day of WBRT at 1000 mg/m2/day and continued daily for 14 days. After a 7 days rest
      period, capecitabine will be restarted at 2000mg/m2/day for 14 days followed by a 7 days
      rest period. This will be given together with sunitinib at 37.5 mg daily. This is the dosing
      determined by the phase I study with capecitabine and sunitinib. Dose reduction and/or
      treatment postponement will be done for significant toxicity. Capecitabine with sunitinib
      will be administered until disease progression in either CNS and/or non-CNS sites. Efficacy
      assessments will be performed on all subjects via imaging studies in the CNS and extra-CNS
      sites 8 weeks after starting study, then every 12 weekly. Neurological examination will be
      performed at baseline, 3 weeks after starting treatment, then every 6 weekly. Assessment of
      treatment toxicity will be performed at baseline, 3 weeks after starting treatment, then
      every 3 weekly using the NCI Common Toxicity grading system. Clinical and laboratory
      parameters will be assessed until disease progression or withdrawal from study (due to
      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent). Subjects with progression of CNS and / or
      extra-CNS disease will be considered progressors. Subjects withdrawn from treatment will be
      followed for survival until death.

      Primary endpoint: 1. To determine progression free survival. Progression will be defined by
      progression in either CNS or extra-CNS metastases. Secondary endpoint: 1. To assess the
      toxicities associated with the regimen 2. To determine the overall objective response in CNS
      disease 3. To determine the overall objective response in extra-CNS disease 4. To determine
      the overall survival.
