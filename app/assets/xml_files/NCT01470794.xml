  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Toca 511, a retroviral
      replicating vector, injected into the resection cavity of patients with recurrent or
      progressive Grade III or Grade IV Gliomas who have elected to undergo surgical removal of
      their tumor.  Approximately 7 weeks after injection of Toca 511, the patient will take an
      oral 8-day course of 5-FC, an antifungal antibiotic. These 8-day courses of 5-FC will be
      repeated a total of 3 times during the 6-month study.  MRI scans will be performed
      approximately every 2 months. Three subjects will be evaluated at up to 4 dose levels of
      Toca 511.  The dose of Toca 511 a patient receives will depend upon the number of previous
      study participants and how well they have tolerated the study drugs. All patients enrolled
      in this study will be encouraged to participate in a continuation protocol that enables
      additional 5-FC administration and the collection of long-term safety and response data.

    <description>All subjects will receive Toca 511, a retroviral replicating vector that expresses the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene.  CD converts the antibiotic 5-FC to the anti-cancer drug 5-FU in cells that have been infected by the Toca 511 vector.  Beginning approximately 7 weeks after administration of Toca 511, subjects will take an 8-day course of oral 5-FC.  These 8-day courses of 5-FC are repeated every 7 weeks for a total of 3 courses during the 6-month study.</description>
