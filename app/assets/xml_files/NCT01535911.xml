    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effects, good and/or bad, of treating primary brain cancers with
      diet therapy using a calorie restricted ketogenic diet that uses either Ketocal or food.  A
      calorie restricted ketogenic diet is a diet designed to keep blood sugars in the low range
      of normal while at the same time increasing the blood concentration of metabolic break down
      products called ketones. This diet is currently used to treat children with uncontrollable
      seizures.  This diet is well tolerated by the children with minimal side effects reported
      after using the diet for years.

        -  The main purpose of this study is to find out whether or not the calorie restricted
           ketogenic diet will help patients with primary brain cancer by either decreasing the
           size of the cancer or by keeping the cancer from growing.

        -  Another reason for doing this study is to learn about the side effects associated with
           the calorie restricted ketogenic diet in patients with primary brain cancer.

      Summary: The current standard of care for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common
      primary brain tumor in adults, includes surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy.
      Survival rarely exceeds 18 months.  The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that
      brain tumor cells are unable to utilize ketones as a source of energy when deprived of
      glucose, due to mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas normal glia and neurons can survive this
      metabolic stress. A nutritionally adequate but energy restricted, ketogenic diet (ERKD) to
      deprive brain tumors of energy and resulting in death of glioma cells is promising.
      ERKD-based therapy to manage brain cancer is both biologically plausible and supported by
      data in animal models. A multidisciplinary team of oncologists, registered dietitians, and
      physiologists will implement an ERKD therapy in two (2) GBM subjects for an 8 week, phase 1
      clinical trial. After receiving standard medical care for GBM including biopsy or tumor
      excision, ERKD therapy will be initiated for subjects during a one week inpatient admission
      to Sparrow Hospital and supervised by registered dietitians experienced in implementing this
      therapy. The objective of this trial is to determine whether the ERKD causes altered glucose
      metabolism in gliomas and decreases tumor size in individuals with GBM as measured by
      positron emission tomography/ computed tomography in the Department of Radiology at MSU.
      Enzymes and signaling pathways that regulate metabolism and cell growth will be assessed in
      initial and post-ERKD tumors using standard biochemical approaches.

    <description>Two adult subjects with reoccurring glioblastoma will be referred to the study. Residual tumor size and baseline glucose uptake will be determined by 18fluoro-deoxyglucose (18FDG) PET/CT. Subjects will then be placed on ERKD for 6 weeks using KetocalÂ® or food. After 6 weeks of ERKD, tumor size and tumor glucose uptake will be determined by 18FDG PET/CT. If the tumor has decreased in size or remained the same (stable disease), the subjects will be continued on the ERKD for an additional 6 weeks. Total calories consumed by each subject will be targeted to 20 to 25 kcal/kg/day. If the tumor has decreased in size or the size has remained the same then subjects will be continued on the ERKD for as additional 6 weeks. After completing 12 weeks of therapy with ERKD, patients will be reevaluated with 18FDG PET/CT. The inability of tumors to metabolize ketones is expected to prevent or slow tumor growth as evidenced by 18FDG PET/CT.</description>
