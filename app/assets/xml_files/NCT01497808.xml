      Stratified phase I/II study of escalating fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy
      combined with immunotherapy for previously untreated/previously treated metastatic melanoma
      patients.  Phase I is stratified by site: bone/lung versus liver/subcutaneous. Phase II is
      stratified by prior treatment: previously untreated versus previously treated.  In phase II,
      14 patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in each stratum of which
      phase I patients treated at the site specific MTD will be included.

    <textblock>
      This is a stratified phase I/II study of escalating fractions of stereotactic body
      radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with immunotherapy with Ipilimumab for previously untreated or
      previously treated metastatic melanoma patients who are aged 18 years or older. Phase I is
      stratified by site: bone or lung versus liver or subcutaneous (s.c.) Six patients will be
      enrolled per dose cohort.  Phase II is stratified by prior treatment:previously untreated
      for metastatic disease versus previously treated for metastatic disease.  In phase II, 14
      patients will be treated at the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) in each stratum of which phase
      I patients treated at the site specific MTD will be included.  Descriptive statistics will
      be generated for both phases of the study.
