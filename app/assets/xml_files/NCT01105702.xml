      This is an open-label, Phase II study to estimate the effect on time to tumor progression
      and safety in patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cycle 1 (42-day cycle):

      Temozolomide will be taken at a dose of 75 mg/m^2 orally, beginning the night prior to the
      first radiation treatment.  Duration of temozolomide treatment is 42 consecutive days.

      Radiation therapy must begin within 3-5 weeks of surgery.  Treatment of 1.8 Gy will be given
      daily for 5 days per week, Monday through Friday.  Treatment will continue for 33 fractions
      for a total dose of 59.4 Gy over 6.5 weeks. All portals shall be treated during each
      treatment session.  Doses are specified as the target dose that shall be to the center of
      the target volume.

      Bevacizumab will be added to the temozolomide/radiation treatment plan 29(+3 if necessary)
      days post surgery . This may be delayed to ensure that 28 days has elapsed between surgery
      and the first dose of bevacizumab. No patient will be treated with bevacizumab before 28
      days after a surgical procedure.

      Bevacizumab treatment continues until the first post-treatment MRI is performed.
      Radiological re-evaluation by MRI with gadolinium contrast with perfusion sequences will be
      performed at 35 days (+ 2 days) after completion of radiation therapy.  Assessment of
      response will continue to be performed following every 2 cycles.

      Treatment Cycle 2-7 (28 day cycles):

      If the Cycle 1 post-treatment MRI is stable or without sign of recurrent tumor the
      subsequent cycles (Cycles 2 - 7) will be administered as follows:

        -  Temozolomide at a dose of 150 mg/m^2 will be taken orally on Days 1-7

        -  Bevacizumab will be administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg per dosing administration on Day
           8 and Day 22

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging is performed after every 2 cycles

      Lithium Carbonate: Initiate treatment at 300 mg PO BID; increase dose every 7 days by 300 mg
      to goal total dose of 1200 mg per day. Serum levels will than be assessed and dose adjusted
      until therapeutic level of 0.8 to 1.2 mEq/L is reached.  Adjust dose according to clinical
      response and trough serum level (12 h) after steady state is reached (4-5 days).
