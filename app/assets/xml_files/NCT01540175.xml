      Autologous stem cell rescue is an established therapy in high risk neuroblastoma and
      relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma and an experimental therapy in some other solid and brain tumors
      to facilitate the use of very intense chemotherapy beyond bone marrow tolerance. It is
      usually tolerated with acceptable toxicity and graft failure is practically not existent.
      But whereas immune reconstitution in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) setting is widely studied, the investigators have no comprehensive data available in
      the autologous setting regarding recovery of the innate and adaptive immune system. However,
      observations in patients with autoimmune disease undergoing autologous HSCT suggest not an
      exact recovery of the patient's pre-transplant immune system but some re-education during
      reconstitution of immune function.

      Also, recent developments of cancer-directed immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies and
      immunocytokines rely on activity of the patient's own immune system via complement-mediated
      or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. These novel therapies are given either with or
      shortly after conventional chemotherapy. To find the optimal time point for administration
      of immunotherapy, it is important to know how and when immune effector cells recover after
      conventional myelosuppressive and/or immunosuppressive chemotherapy which are used in
      Induction regimens.

      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to study the research
      participant's immune profile once prior and at multiple set time points after autologous
      stem cell infusion during the recovery process. In a subset of participants the
      investigators want to study the recovery of lymphocyte subsets and function after one course
      of conventional chemotherapy preceding the high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
      transplant. That way the investigators hope to learn about the pace and order of recovery
      and the functional capacity of different compartments of the immune system during
      reconstitution.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the immune reconstitution of T cell-, B cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-
           compartment in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant as part of their
           treatment for a malignancy.

      The design for this study will be a prospective, longitudinal observational study. Immune
      reconstitution will be measured in the course of autologous stem cell transplant using
      serial blood samples analyzed for cell counts, immune cell phenotyping (demonstrating the
      expression of specific receptors on the cell surface) and functional lymphocyte assays.
      These blood samples will be obtained once prior and at defined time points after stem cell
      infusion either while the research participant is hospitalized or during the scheduled
      clinic visit.

      Immune recovery from conventional chemotherapy will be measured using serial blood samples
      analyzed for cell counts, immune cell phenotyping, and NK cell functional assays. These
      blood samples will be obtained once prior and at defined time points after completion of
      courses #1 and #4 of Induction chemotherapy while the research participant is hospitalized
      or during the scheduled clinic visit.

    <description>The order and magnitude of recovery of the different subtypes of leukocytes will be summarized by descriptive statistics. The pattern of immune reconstitution will be evaluated using longitudinal approaches such as Mixed effect models or GEE approach and implement in SAS 9.2 using PROC MIXED or PROC GENMOD.
In addition, NK cell number, receptor and ligand genotype and phenotype and functional capacity will be compared at specific time points (28 days, 8 weeks and 6 months post  autologous transplant) to  the baseline values using paired one sample signed rank test.</description>

    <description>Research participants agree to have blood samples obtained at the time of diagnosis before any chemotherapy, if available, and prior to high dose chemotherapy regimen with autologous HSCT as well as on days 14, 21, 28, week 8 and months 3, 6, 12 and 18 after autologous HSCT. Research participants with high risk neuroblastoma may also agree to have blood samples taken before and twice in the recovery period (days 0, 7 and 15-18) of Induction chemotherapy courses one and four.</description>
