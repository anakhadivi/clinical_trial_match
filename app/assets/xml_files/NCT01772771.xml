  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to perform standardized testing to determine which different genes
      are mutated (have gone through changes) in cancer patients to provide them with personalized
      cancer therapy. A patient's doctor may be able to use testing information on their tumor to
      identify clinical trials that may be most relevant to them.

      Another goal of this laboratory research study is to learn how often different genes mutate
      in patients with different cancers.  Researchers will also use the information learned from
      this study to develop a database of the different kinds of mutations in cancer-related
      genes.

      Researchers also hope to better understand how mutations in cancer-related genes may affect
      a patient's response to different therapies. Researchers can use this information to select
      specific therapies for future patients that are more likely to be effective.

      Information about patients/participants' diseases and previous and future treatments and
      outcomes will be recorded from medical records. A sample of tumor tissue that was already
      collected and stored at MD Anderson or another institution will be collected. Blood (about 4
      teaspoons) will be drawn so that researchers have a sample of normal cells to use for
      comparison to cancer cells, a saliva sample or a cheek cell sample may be collected instead
      of the blood sample.

      The MD Anderson Cancer Center Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Institute for Personalized
      Cancer Therapy (IPCT) is committed to implementing personalized cancer therapy for all
      patients coming to MD Anderson, transforming cancer patient management and improving
      outcomes by making this approach the new standard of care. The ultimate goal is to perform
      in-depth molecular characterization of all tumors, in order to tailor therapies offered and
      identify best standard of care and clinical trial options.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented invasive cancer,
             suspected glioma, sarcoma, melanoma or hematologic cancer. Patients with benign
             tumors may also be consented at the discretion of the attending physician if
             molecular profiling is felt to have potential clinical implications.

          2. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

          3. Patients may be consented without confirming the amount and quality of archival
             diagnostic or residual tissue available. However, research testing will only be
             performed on patients who have sufficient archived diagnostic tissue or residual
             tissue banked in one of the authorized tissue banks at MD Anderson available to
             proceed with testing.  The extent of testing may be modified based on amount of
             tissue available. If a new biopsy is being ordered for clinical care or another
             research study, or an operation is being performed testing can be ordered on that
             sample.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        None.
