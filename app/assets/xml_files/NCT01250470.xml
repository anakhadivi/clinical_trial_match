    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and sargramostim in
      treating patients with malignant glioma. Vaccines made from survivin peptide may help the
      body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of the SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide in Montanide ISA 51
      plus with GM-CSF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the immune responses induced by SVN53-67/M57-KLH with Montanide ISA 51 with
      GM-CSF.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect preliminary data on therapeutic efficacy of this combination against malignant
      glioma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive montanide ISA-51/survivin peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) followed by
      sargramostim SC on day 0. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 16, 20, and 24.
