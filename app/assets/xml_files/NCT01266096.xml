  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current tests to detect cancer, including CAT scans and MRI scans, are limited. PET scans
      use special dyes that are injected into a vein and can better localize possible cancer. The
      investigators have developed a new particle that can carry a radioactive dye to a very
      specific area of the tumor. When using a PET scan the radioactive dye can be viewed in areas
      of possible disease. This particle has been studied in mice and was safe.

      The particles will not treat the cancer and any images or information found during this
      study will not be used for your treatment. The information collected may be used to guide
      the design of future studies to detect and/or treat tumors.

    <description>This is a two-year microdosing study that will enroll 5 metastatic melanoma and up patients to 6 brain tumor patients at MSKCC who have either have a high grade glioma (n=3) or brain metastases (n=3) from melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, or other non-CNS primary lesion. We have already accrued 5 melanoma patients and expect to accrue brain tumor patients within a 1 year period.</description>

    <description>Five (5) patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent melanoma and up to six (6) patients with either primary or metastatic brain tumors, will be i.v. injected with approximately 5 mCi (3.4-6.7 nanomoles) of 124I-cRGDY-PEG-dots (specific activity range 750.0 - 1450 mCi/mol) and undergo the microdosing study for purposes of collecting pharmacokinetic and dosimetry data. All studies will be performed using a dedicated GE STE PET/CT scanner, which integrates a dedicated PET scanner and a spiral CT with proprietary fusion software.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma or malignant brain tumor at MSKCC

          -  Newly-diagnosed or recurrent (local,regional, metastatic) metastatic melanoma or
             malignant brain tumor patients with

          -  Residual clinically or radiographically evident tumor, including primary cutaneous
             and mucosal melanomas or malignant brain tumor

          -  Prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery in patients requiring flap
             reconstruction in the head and neck region.

          -  Newly diagnosed patients with previous excisional biopsy.

          -  Normal baseline cardiac function based upon EKG and pre-operative evaluation

          -  ANC&gt;1000/mcl and platelets&gt;100,000/mcl.

          -  Bilirubin level of &lt; 2.0 mg/dl in the absence of a history of Gilbert's disease (or
             pattern consistent with Gilbert's).

          -  If patients have a history of malignancy other than melanoma or malignant brain tumor
             they must be disease-free for ≥ 5 years at the time of enrollment.

          -  All patients of childbearing and child-creating age must be using an acceptable form
             of birth control

          -  Women who are pre-menopausal must have a negative serum pregnancy test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or other thyroid disease

          -  Known pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          -  Medical illness unrelated to the tumor which in the opinion of the attending
             physician and principal investigator will preclude administration of the tracer. This
             includes patients with uncontrolled infection, chronic renal insufficiency,
             myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmias
             other than chronic atrial fibrillation and chronic active or persistent hepatitis, or
             New York Heart Association Classification III or IV heart disease.

          -  History of any malignancy other than melanoma or malignant brain tumors for which the
             disease-free interval is &lt;5 years.

          -  Allergic reaction to iodine-containing contrast material

          -  Weight greater than the 400-lb weight limit of the PET scanner

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Inability to lie in the scanner for 30 minutes
