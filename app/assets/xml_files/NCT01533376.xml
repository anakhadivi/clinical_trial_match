      Primary Objective:

      • To assess the possible utility of topical timolol in the management of port-wine mark
      (PWM) in Sturge-Weber syndrome in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Port-wine mark (PWM) represents a congenital capillary malformation,characterized  by
      dilation and malformation of dermal capillaries that lack endothelial proliferation. It is
      frequently seen in the facial distribution of the trigeminal nerve. PWM persists throughout
      life and involves ~0.3% of the population.  Although PWMs are found in other circumstances,
      ~ 3% of patients with facial PWM are also afflicted with Sturge-Weber syndrome. PWMs are
      cosmetic entities that often have serious social consequences, producing psychological
      trauma to both children and their parents. PWM does not involute with time, and, if left
      untreated, can develop deep purple coloration, tissue hypertrophy, and nodularity.

      Laser therapy, which selectively destroys specific targets within the skin, is currently the
      most commonly used approach for treating PWM, although complete blanching of the PWM after
      laser is rarely achieved for most patients, and only 10-45% of patients with Sturge-Weber
      have shown satisfactory outcomes. Complications of  pulsed  dye laser treatment for PWM
      include pyogenic granuloma, scabbing, cutaneous scarring, and permanent
      hypo/hyperpigmentation. Laser treatment is relatively contraindicated in children with
      darker skin coloration due to the resulting hypopigmentation which may be equally unsightly.
      Laser treatment causes substantial discomfort and pain to patients, and often requires
      general anesthesia in children.   This is particularly true since earlier treatment in
      infancy is desirable and yields increased successful resolution of the PWM. The hypertrophic
      PWM in later years is resistant to any treatment.   Recently, propranolol was reported to
      successfully treat capillary hemangioma in infants.13  While the mechanism by which beta
      blockade improves hemangioma is unclear, ß2-mediated vasoconstrictive effects and the
      ensuing apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells may contribute to the positive therapeutic
      results.

      Oral application of propranolol can cause severe systemic complications, including
      bronchospasm, vasospasm, hypoglycemia, hypotension, severe bradycardia, heart block, and
      congestive heart failure.  Topical timolol solution, a β-blocker, has shown a similar
      ability to reduce capillary hemangioma of eyelids with little or no systemic effects in a
      small pilot study.  Similar to capillary hemangioma, which is a proliferative lesion
      characterized  by increased endothelial cell turnover, PWM is a capillary malformation with
      abnormal endothelial cells and large surface area of dilated capillaries. Thus, both
      capillary hemangioma and PWM share the similar characteristic of abnormal capillary
      endothelial cells.

      This pilot study is designed to explore the potential role of topical timolol in the
      management of PWM. As PWM is so frequently associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a disorder
      in which approximately 50% of patients will develop glaucoma, this study will be conducted
      in an ophthalmology setting.

      This study will consist of two arms. One group will receive timolol and the second group a
      placebo preservative free artificial tear gel. The groups will be divided with a ratio of
      1:1 and the Timolol group will be matched with the placebo group by PWM location, age and
      race.

      Both medications are to be applied and rubbed in by fingertip to the treatment site twice a
      day for 6 months by subject's parents/guardian. (Treatment site: 1x1 cm at inferior edge of
      facial PWM)

      Follow-up schedule: 1 week after treatment initiation and then every 2 months for a period
      of six months.
