      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and dendritic cells may help the body
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating
      patients undergoing surgery for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility and safety of an autologous brain tumor stem cell
           mRNA-loaded dendritic cell vaccine in adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma
           multiforme.

      Secondary

        -  To assess humoral and cellular immune responses to vaccination.

        -  To compare the proportion of vaccinated patients alive at 6 months from the time of
           surgery for recurrent tumor with matched historical cohorts.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgical resection of tumor. Tumor tissue samples are collected to
      isolate brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) and for extraction and amplification of BTSC-specific
      mRNA. Within 4 weeks after surgical resection, patients undergo leukapheresis over 4 hours
      to generate dendritic cells (DCs). Patients also undergo leukapheresis at 1 week after the
      third vaccination and then at least every 3 months as needed for generation of additional
      DCs.

      Patients receive autologous BTSC mRNA-loaded DC vaccine intradermally once weekly for 3
      weeks and then once monthly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
