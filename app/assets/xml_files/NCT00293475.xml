      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells
      and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Chemotherapy drugs such as
      methotrexate, carboplatin, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoprotective
      drugs, such as sodium thiosulfate, may protect normal cells from the side effects of
      chemotherapy. Osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption uses mannitol, to open tight junctions
      in the blood vessels in the brain and allow methotrexate and carboplatin to be carried to
      tumor. Giving rituximab together with blood-brain barrier disruption and methotrexate-based
      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of carboplatin
      when given together with rituximab and methotrexate with blood-brain barrier disruption and
      delayed  sodium thiosulfate chemoprotection to see how well they work in treating patients
      with newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicities of rituximab in combination with blood-brain barrier
           disruption with mannitol, combination chemotherapy comprising methotrexate and
           carboplatin, and delayed sodium thiosulfate.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on complete response (CR) rate within the first 3
           months of treatment in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the overall CR response rate, the 2-year overall survival, and the 2-year
           event-free survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I/II study

        -  Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 followed by blood-brain barrier disruption
           comprising mannitol intra-arterially (IA) and combination chemotherapy comprising
           methotrexate IA over 10 minutes and carboplatin IA over 10 minutes on days 2 and 3.
           Patients also receive sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes twice on days 2 and 3 and
           filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 5 and continuing for
           approximately 7-10 days or until blood counts recover OR pegfilgrastim SC once on day
           5. Patients with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology also receive cytarabine
           via Ommaya reservoir or lumbar puncture on day 14. Patients with ocular involvement
           also receive injections of methotrexate and/or rituximab into the eye(s) up to twice a
           week until the vitreous is clear of cancer cells and then as determined by the
           ophthalmologist.

        -  Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months during treatment, at completion
           of treatment, and then every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and
           annually thereafter.
