      The objective of this study is to evaluate patients with tumors of the central nervous
      system (CNS) for eligibility in the National Cancer Institute's research studies. These
      patients will undergo a series of procedures, usually including a complete medical history
      and physical examination; laboratory testing of blood, CSF, urine, bone marrow, or other
      samples; an evaluation of tumor location and size by x-rays, CT (computed tomography) or MRI
      (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, or nuclear medicine scans; lumbar puncture;
      electrocardiogram and echocardiogram; and procedures to evaluate the function of specific
      organs. A bone marrow biopsy is occasionally performed. Research samples may also be
      collected and stored to avoid having to do a painful test more than once.  Tissue specimens
      collected during this process may be stored and used in future studies.

      Patients of both genders, any age, and all racial and ethnic groups with tumors of the CNS
      or a history of a CNS tumor are eligible. Up to 100 people are expected to participate.

      The physician will discuss the results of these procedures with the patient and his or her
      family.  On the basis of the eligibility screening and the patient's wishes, the patient may
      then be enrolled in a primary research protocol.

      BACKGROUND:

      -Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 yrs of age) with tumors of the central nervous
      system who are being evaluated by the Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) for National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) primary research protocols will be entered onto this screening protocol for
      eligibility screening.

      OBJECTIVE:

      - Evaluate patients with tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS) for eligibility in
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) research protocols.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      - Patients with tumors of the CNS or a history of a CNS tumor who are being evaluated for
      protocols within the National Cancer Institute.

      DESIGN:

        -  The screening tests and procedures that are required by the primary research protocols
           will be conducted in order to establish eligibility for these protocols.

        -  These procedures may include, but are not limited to, laboratory tests on blood, CSF,
           urine, or other specimens, and radiographic and nuclear medicine studies, which may
           require the administration of contrast or a radioisotopic tracer.

        -  In some cases, specific research samples required for the primary research protocol may
           be collected during the screening process in order to prevent us from having to subject
           the patient to a painful procedure on multiple occasions (e.g., bone marrow
           aspirations).

        -  Research specimens will be discarded, if the patient is not eligible for or elects not
           to enroll on the primary research protocol. A total of 3000 patients will be enrolled.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 yrs of age) with tumors of the CNS or a
        history of a CNS tumor who are being evaluated for protocols within the National Cancer
        Institute.

        All patients or their previously designated LAR (Legally Authorized Representative) (if
        the patient is deemed by the treating physician to be impaired or questionably impaired in
        such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is questionable) must
        sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of
        this study and the risks of the procedures that will be performed to assess eligibility
        for primary research protocols.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        None
