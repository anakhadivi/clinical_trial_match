      RATIONALE: Providing a computer training program may improve the well-being and quality of
      life of patients with cognitive (physical and mental) function difficulties caused by
      radiation therapy to the brain.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial studies how well an adaptive computerized cognitive
      training program works compared to a non-adaptive computerized cognitive training program in
      treating younger patients with brain tumor who underwent radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the feasibility of a home-based, computerized, cognitive training program for
           patients with pediatric brain tumors who are undergoing cranial radiation therapy
           (CRT), treated in multiple Children Oncology Group (COG) institutions.

        -  To estimate the effect size of this program on measures of attention and working memory
           in patients with brain tumors treated with CRT in order to design a definitive
           large-scale clinical trial. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to known risk
      factors including age (&lt; 8 years vs ≥ 8 years), treatment intensity (whole brain vs focal
      radiation). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (intervention): Patients undergo a home-based, computerized, interactive training
           program comprising 3-5 sessions of 15-45 minutes every week for 5-9 weeks. The program
           contains twelve visually engaging and interesting exercises that target skills
           involving visual-spatial and verbal working memory (WM). The program is adaptive in a
           way that each difficulty task is automatically adjusted on a trial-by-trail basis to
           match a patient's current WM. Each patient has an interventional coach who has online
           access to patient's training sessions and outcomes (pass or fail). Coaches are able to
           modify the training sequence or make suggestions to patients and/or parents about how
           progress can be maximized. Coaches also have telephone meetings with patients and/or
           families once a week to ensure compliance, track progress, provide feedback, and answer
           questions that arise during training.

        -  Arm II (control): Patients undergo a home-based, computerized, interactive,
           non-adaptive training program comprising 3-5 sessions of 15-45 minutes a week for 5-9
           weeks. Each patient also has an interventional coach as in arm I.

      Patients in both arms complete a brief neuropsychological/behavioral assessment comprising
      the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WIS-IV), the Children's Memory Scale (CMS),
      and the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) at baseline, after
      completion of study, and at 6 months after completion of study. Additionally, parents
      complete a parent-report questionnaire to gather information about patient's behaviors,
      thoughts, emotions, adaptive skills, and social and functional impairment. Parents and
      children also complete surveys about the program regarding technical feasibility, adherence,
      ease-of-use, and satisfaction.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Patient must be newly diagnosed (i.e., not relapsed) with a brain tumor; patients
             with pontine glioma are not eligible

          -  Patients with a history of traumatic brain injury prior to tumor diagnosis are not
             eligible

          -  Patients with a tumor relapse or disease progression are not eligible to participate
             in this trial

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Patient is currently being followed at 1 of the participating sites

          -  Patients diagnosed with any Axis I mental health disorder (e.g., depression) that, in
             the examining psychologist's opinion, would preclude or take treatment precedence
             over participation in computerized training will not be eligible

          -  The patient must have an identified caregiver who is willing and able to oversee the
             training practice during the intervention period (i.e., for 5-9 weeks starting
             approximately 3 months after completion of cranial radiation therapy [CRT]).

             English

          -  Patients with photosensitive seizures are not eligible to participate in this trial

          -  Patients with a motor, visual, or auditory handicap that prevents computer use (e.g.,
             unresolved posterior fossa syndrome) are not eligible to participate in this trial

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  Patient is within three (3) ± one (1) calendar months following completion of cranial
