      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of trebananib in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including central nervous system tumors.
      Trebananib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      trebananib (AMG 386) administered as a weekly intravenous infusion to children with
      recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

      II. To determine the tolerability of the solid tumor MTD and/or RP2D of AMG 386 in children
      with central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

      III. To define and describe the toxicities of AMG 386 administered on this schedule.

      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of AMG 386 in children with
      refractory cancer.

      V. To measure changes in vascular permeability relative to baseline, evaluated by magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion, following AMG 386 administration in pediatric patients
      with CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of AMG 386 within the confines of a Phase
      1 study.

      II. To measure biologic markers of angiogenesis with potential for correlation with disease
      response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study (part 1) followed by a safety and
      imaging study (part 2).

      Patients receive trebananib intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity studies. Blood may also be collected for correlative
      studies. Some patients also undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI at baseline and
      periodically during study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 to 6 months for up to
      1 year.
