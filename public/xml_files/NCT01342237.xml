      The investigators plan to improve event free survival rate and reduce treatment related
      toxicities of pediatric patients with high risk/recurrent CNS tumors by administrating

    <textblock>
      High risk/recurrent central nervous system (CNS) tumors have a poor prognosis so that tandem
      high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with hematopoietic progenitor stem cell rescues has been
      chosen as potentially curative therapy. Many institutions have used carboplatin, thiotepa,
      etoposide (CTE) for conditioning regimen of 1st HDCT and cyclophosphamide, melphalan (CM)
      for conditioning regimen of 2nd HDCT. Our institution applied this regimen to the 38
      pediatric patients with high risk brain tumor since 1996. Although the 3 year overall
      survival rate and event free survival rate were improved to 69% and 47.9%, respectively, the
      results showed relatively high treatment related mortality (TRM) rate of 21%. Toxicity of
      this tandem regimen was also reported as being high up to 32% in other researches as well so
      that this regimen is considered not feasible due to toxicity. In this study, the
      investigators plan to improve event free survival rate and reduce treatment related
      toxicities of pediatric patients with high risk/recurrent CNS tumors by administrating
      tandem high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue with topotecan, thiotepa,
      carboplatin (TTC) for 1st HDCT and melphalan, etoposide, carboplatin (MEC) for 2nd HDCT.
