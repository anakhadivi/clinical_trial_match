      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known
      whether giving temozolomide alone, radiation therapy alone, or temozolomide together with
      radiation therapy is more effective in treating anaplastic glioma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing giving temozolomide alone, radiation
      therapy alone, or Temozolomide together to see which works best in treating patients with
      newly diagnosed anaplastic glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether there is a survival advantage for patients with newly diagnosed
           1p/19q codeleted anaplastic glioma who receive concurrent temozolomide and radiotherapy
           (RT) followed by adjuvant temozolomide over that observed in patients treated with RT
           alone (control).

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether there is a neurocognitive advantage in patients who receive
           temozolomide alone (Arm III) vs temozolomide with concurrent RT (Arm II) over that
           observed in patients treated with RT alone (Arm I).

        -  Determine whether there is a difference in survival based on t(1;19)(q10,p10)
           translocation status and MGMT promoter hypermethylation status in these patients.

        -  Perform descriptive comparisons of additional secondary outcome endpoints, including
           time to progression, progression free survival, and the proportion of patients free of
           progression at 6, 12, and 24 months.

        -  Determine the toxicity of RT and concurrent/adjuvant temozolomide in these patients.

        -  Determine descriptively whether it is reasonable to delay RT by documenting the time to
           progression and progression-free survival of patients receiving temozolomide alone.

        -  Determine the quality of life and neurocognitive effects in patients treated on this
           protocol and correlate these results with outcome endpoints.

        -  Bank blood products (i.e., plasma, DNA, and buffy coat) and tumor tissue for future
           scientific investigations.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to cooperative group
      (EORTC vs North American groups [NCCTG, RTOG, CTSU, and NCIC CTG]), age (â‰¤ 50 years vs &gt; 50
      years), and ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy (RT) 5 days a week for 6 weeks in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo RT as in arm I and receive oral temozolomide once daily on
           days 1-7 for 6 weeks. Beginning 4 weeks after completion of concurrent
           chemoradiotherapy, patients receive adjuvant oral temozolomide once daily days 1-5.
           Treatment with adjuvant temozolomide repeats every 28 days for 6-12 courses in the
           absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Patients complete neurocognitive questionnaires (i.e., the Hopkins Verbal Learning test, the
      Controlled Oral Word Association test from the Multilingual Aphasia Examination, General
      Mental Ability: Trail Making tests A and B, and the Recall and Recognition of Word List
      encoded from the HVLT-R test) and quality of life questionnaires (i.e., EORTC QOL-C30 and
      QOL-BN20) at baseline and periodically during study therapy.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected during surgery and analyzed by FISH to detect t(1:19),
      and for MGMT gene promoter hypermethylation status and additional known prognostic markers,
      including but not limited to PTEN, EGFR, EGFRvIII, and p53.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
