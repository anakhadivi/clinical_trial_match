      This study will analyze the effects of radiation given to children who have tumors of the
      central nervous system (CNS). Researchers want to learn more about changes in the quality of
      life that patients may experience as a result of radiation.

      Patients ages 21 and younger who have a primary CNS tumor and who have not received
      radiation previously may be eligible for this study. They will have a medical history and
      physical examination.  Collection of blood (about 2-1/2 tablespoons) and urine will be done,
      as well as a pregnancy test. Patients will complete neuropsychological tests, which provide
      information about their changes in functioning over time. An expert in psychology will give
      a number of tests, and the patient's parents or guardian will be asked to complete a
      questionnaire about the patient's behavior. Also, patients will be given a quality of life
      questionnaire to complete and vision and hearing tests. The radiation itself is prescribed
      by patients' doctors and is not part of this study.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will give researchers information about the tumor and
      brain, through several scanning sequences . MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves
      to obtain images of body organs and tissues. Patients will lie on a table that slides into
      the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will need to lie still, and medication may be given
      to help them to do that. They may be in the scanner for up to 2 hours. As the scanner takes
      pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds, and they will wear earplugs to
      reduce the noise. A contrast agent will be administered, to allow images be seen more
      clearly. Blood and urine tests will be conducted after the first dose of radiation. MRI
      scans will be done 2 weeks after patients finish radiation therapy and again at 6 to 8
      weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly. Also at those follow-up periods, patients will
      undergo similar procedures as previously, including blood and urine tests and
      neuropsychological testing. Patients can remain in this study for 5 years.

      Background:

      This exploratory study will be performed in pediatric patients with CNS tumors who are
      undergoing radiation therapy to investigate pathophysiologic effects of radiation on the
      CNS. The study includes the analysis of blood, urine, and CSF (if available) to measure
      biological markers involved with angiogenesis, blood: brain barrier integrity, and
      neurotoxicity. It also entails comprehensive MR imaging techniques and neuropsychological
      testing in an effort to correlate changes with biomarker measurements.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives

        1. To detect changes in angiogenesis related to radiation of the CNS by:

             -  Measurement of VEGF, bFGF, thrombospondin, TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-8, and MMP in
                blood and urine specimens.

             -  MR perfusion and DEMRI.

        2. To describe changes in blood:brain barrier permeability associated with radiation of
           the CNS.

        3. To characterize neurotoxicity by:

             -  Measuring biomarkers associated with neurotoxicity, including NF-1, NSE,
                S100-Beta, GFAP, and quinolinic acid in blood and CSF.

             -  Documenting changes in neurobehavioral functioning through longitudinal
                comprehensive assessments

             -  Describing changes in quality of life (QOL)

             -  Assessing changes in memory

             -  Defining changes in ophthalmologic studies associated with radiation.

             -  Detecting changes in audiometry associated with radiation.

      Eligibility Criteria:

        -  Patients must have a primary CNS tumor for which radiation therapy is recommended.

        -  Patients must be less than or equal to 21 yrs of age.

        -  Prior/Concurrent: Patients will be eligible if they have not received prior radiation.
           Patients who have undergone surgery or received chemotherapy are eligible.

        -  Performance Status: Patients will be eligible regardless of performance score.

      Design:

      This minimally invasive study is designed to explore various biologic effects of radiation
      on the pediatric CNS in an attempt to 1) obtain information on the pathophysiology of
      radiation-induced damage, 2) explore the association of neuropsychological deficits with
      biologic markers and neuroimaging abnormalities, 3) document changes in neurobehavioral
      functioning through longitudinal comprehensive neuropsychological assessments with
      comparison of various radiation therapy techniques, 4) describe changes in quality of life
      in pediatric patients who have received radiation therapy, and 5) attempt to identify
      children at increased risk of radiation-induced neurotoxicity.
