      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy
      that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and
      cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temozolomide when
      given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide when given in combination with
           hypofractionated intensity-modulated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy in patients
           with newly diagnosed de novo glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to neuroradiological evidence of tumor recurrence or progression
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the survival time of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the time spent in a Karnofsky performance status of 60-100%.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide.

      Beginning 1-3 weeks following surgery or biopsy, patients receive oral temozolomide once
      daily for 5 weeks. Beginning 1 week after starting temozolomide, patients also undergo
      hypofractionated intensity-modulated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy once daily 5 days a
      week for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, 2 months, and 3
      months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

    <description>Chemotherapy will be given for 5 weeks; it will start 1 week before Radiotherapy, will continue for the 3 weeks of Radiotherapy, and will continue for 1 week post-Radiotherapy.
Dose Level 1: 50 mg/m2 x first 4 weeks/75 mg/m2 x last 1 weeks of treatment Dose Level 2: 65 mg/m2 x first 4 weeks/75 mg/m2 x last 1 weeks of treatment Dose Level 3: 75 mg/m2 over the entire 5 weeks of treatment</description>

    <description>Radiation therapy will be started up to 8 weeks after surgery/biopsy. Patients will receive focal radiation therapy to an area including the Gross Target Volume (GTV) defined as the contrast enhancing area and/or the surgical cavity plus the surrounding edema + 2 cm margin. GTV will be determined with a contrast enhanced pre RT MRI/CT scan of the brain.</description>
