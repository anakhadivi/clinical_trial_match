      This is an open-label, sequential dose exploration study of single agent AMG 595
      administered in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme and/or anaplastic
      astrocytomas.  This study consist of two parts.  The dose exploration in Part 1, studies of
      cohorts of 3 subjects with recurrent  Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and/or Anaplastic
      Astrocytomas (AA) and uses a practical continuous reassessment model [CRM] to guide dose
      escalation and define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The dose expansion in Part 2 will
      enroll 30 subjects with  GBM at a dose no higher than the MTD to further explore the safety,
      PK, and clinical activity of AMG 595 in this patient population.

      Eligible subjects enrolled in the study will receive AMG 595 beginning at study day 1.
      Following the first two dose of AMG 595 and upon successful completion of a 28 days window
      for assessing dose limiting toxicities, subject will undergo radiological assessment of
      their tumors with MRI during week 5.  Dosing may resume at week 7 unless there is
      radiological evidence of progressive disease per Macdonald criteria, the subject becomes
      intolerant to the study medication, signs and symptoms of clinical progression are evident
      as determined by the investigator, or the subject withdraws consent.
