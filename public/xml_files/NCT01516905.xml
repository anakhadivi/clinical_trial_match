    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate diagnostic imaging techniques using 124I-NM404
      PET/CT in humans with brain metastases and GBMs. This goal will be accomplished by
      determining the optimal PET/CT protocol and comparing PET tumor uptake to MRI and
      calculating tumor dosimetry. A future aim of this study will be to compare non-invasive
      PET/CT and MRI findings with pathological specimens, which is the gold standard but is
      invasive and impractical in many cases, to determine the sensitivity and specificity of both
      techniques for accurately detecting tumor infiltration. The data obtained from this study
      will be used to develop larger diagnostic and therapeutic trials in brain tumors. The
      long-term goals of this research are to improve the diagnosis and treatment of malignant
      brain tumors by using radioiodinated NM404.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants will have a contrast enhanced brain MRI which documents evidence of GBM
             or metastatic brain tumor

          2. Tumor size at least 1.5 cm in greatest axial dimension on MRI. MRI must be obtained
             within 2 months of study inclusion

          3. Female patients must not be pregnant or breast feeding and both women of childbearing
             potential, and men, must use appropriate means of contraception and must be
             maintained for at least 45 days after injection of I-124 NM404. Participants must not
             attempt to become pregnant during this time

          4. Platelet count must be ≥ 160,000/µl, Hematocrit must be ≥ 22%, Leukocyte count must
             be ≥ 3,000/µL, Creatinine must be ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, ALT must be ≤ 130 U/L, AST must be ≤
             100 U/L, and urine or serum pregnancy test must be negative for pregnancy

          5. Karnofsky score ≥ 60

          6. For brain metastases patients: targeted brain therapy (radiation or drug) must have
             concluded ≥2 months prior to injection of 124I-NM404

          7. For GBM tumors confirmed by surgical biopsy or suspected by MRI: no previous surgical
             resection (except for biopsy) or systemic or radiation therapy targeted to the GBM
             tumor -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy of &lt; 3 months

          2. Allergy to potassium iodide (SSKI or Thyroshield)

          3. Planned surgical resection or biopsy after injection of 124I-NM404 and prior to
             completion of the 3rd PET/CT scan

          4. Unwilling or unable to complete 3 separate PET/CT imaging sessions of 90 minutes each
             over 3 days -
