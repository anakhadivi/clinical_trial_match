      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiation therapy, that
      delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause
      less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the best way to give proton beam radiation
      therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with low grade gliomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of proton beam radiation therapy in patients with low grade
      gliomas. (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess late complications from irradiation using proton beam therapy in place of
      conventional photon beam therapy for the treatment of low grade gliomas. (Phase II) II. To
      assess acute side effects from irradiation using proton beam therapy in place of
      conventional photon beam therapy for the treatment of low grade gliomas. (Phase II) III. To
      compare the dose distribution to tumor and surrounding normal structures using DVH's (Dose
      Volume Histograms) generated from the proton plan used to treat the patient and the photon
      plan generated for comparison purposes. (Phase II) IV. To monitor the rates of local
      control, overall and disease specific survival using proton radiotherapy. (Phase II) V. To
      evaluate the time to progression of low grade gliomas treated with protons. (Phase II) VI.
      To evaluate the incidence and severity of fatigue in low grade glioma treated with protons.
      (Phase II) VII. To evaluate the effect of proton beam radiation on neurocognitive outcome in
      patients with low grade glioma. (Phase II) VIII. To evaluate the quality of life in patients
      treated for low grade glioma. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy for 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
