  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new method to treat Diffuse Intrinsic
      Pontine Glioma (DIPG). The researchers will use &quot;convection-enhanced delivery&quot; (CED) to
      deliver an agent called 124I-8H9. CED is performed during surgery. The study agent is
      infused through a small tube placed into the tumor in the brain. Many studies have shown
      this can safely be done in animals but this study is the first time 124I-8H9 will be given
      by CED in humans. This will be one of the first times that CED has been performed in the
      brain stem.

      8H9 is something called an antibody. Antibodies are made by the body to fight infections and
      sometimes cancer. The antibody 8H9 is produced by mice and can attack many kinds of tumors.
      A radioactive substance, 124I, is attached to 8H9. 124I-8H9 sticks to parts of tumor cells
      and can cause the tumor cells to die from radiation. Studies have also been done on humans
      using 124I-8H9 to treat other kinds of cancer. Our studies of some DPG and related tumors
      suggest that 8H9 will bind to the tumor, but the investigators don't know that for sure.

      In this study, the researchers want to find out how safe 124I-8H9 given by CED is at
      different dose levels. They will look to see what effects (both good and bad) it has on the
      patient. The dose of 124I-8H9 will increase for each new group of patients. The amount they
      get will depend on when they enter the study. If too many serious side effects are seen with
      a certain dose, no one will be treated with a higher dose, and some more patients may be
      treated with a lower dose to make sure that dose is safe.

    <description>Determination that a dose is safe will be made following the treatment of at least 3 but no more than 6 patients at a particular dose level. The dose levels are DL1 (0.25 mCi), DL2 (0.5 mCi), DL3 (0.75 mCi), DL4 (1 mCi) and fallback DL0 (0.125 mCi). An incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the range of 25% is considered acceptable in this population.</description>

    <description>Each patient is planned to undergo stereotactic placement of an infusion cannula. Through this cannula, CED of 124I-8H9 at a rate of ≤ 10 μl/min will be performed. Infusion doses of 124I-8H9 will be incrementally increased in subsequent groups of patients to test for safety of the procedure and therapeutic agent (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mCi).  They will be monitored for a minimum of one night in the pediatric intensive care unit after the completion of the infusion. They will then be transferred to the standard pediatric inpatient ward for observation and discharged once deemed appropriate by the principal or co-investigators. PET/CT scans will be performed following surgery to document both radiographic change and infusate distribution in tumor as well as to provide the time-activity data needed for radiation dosimetry analysis. PET/CT will be performed of the entire body, low mA will be used.</description>
