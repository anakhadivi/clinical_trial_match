  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This laboratory study is looking at stored tumor samples in young patients with brain
      tumors. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      The overall objective of this non-therapeutic protocol is to identify molecular
      abnormalities within prospectively treated pediatric CNS Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors
      (ATRT), Choroid Plexus Carcinomas (CPC), and Ependymoma tumors and define the relationship
      between these abnormalities and tumor histologic and clinical characteristics. This
      objective will be achieved by applying state-of-the-art DNA, RNA and protein analysis tools
      to the study of fresh frozen, fixed and cultured tumor cells. The establishment of cell
      cultures from each tumor sample will also allow for in vitro analysis of tumor cell growth,
      signaling and therapeutic response.

        Participants will have ATRT, CPC, medulloblastoma/PNET or ependymoma of the CNS as
        documented by the local neuropathologist. All studies will be conducted using tumor
        material collected prospectively from a clinically well characterized patient cohort.

          -  Age not more than 21 years at the time of initial diagnosis.

          -  Enrollment in the current version of the institution's banking protocol

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Diagnosis other than ATRT, CPC, medulloblastoma/PNET or ependymoma of the central
             nervous system.

          -  Age greater than 21 years at the time of diagnosis
