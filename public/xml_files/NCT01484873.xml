  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether exenatide can cause weight loss in
      patients with a history of craniopharyngioma or other brain lesion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothalamic obesity occurs in up to 60% of patients with tumors in the hypothalamic region,
      most commonly craniopharyngiomas. Hypothalamic dysfunction can be due to tumor infiltration
      and as a consequence of surgery or radiation therapy. Survivors who develop obesity have
      greater morbidity and mortality than normal weight survivors. Prevention and treatment of
      obesity in this population is vital in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality from
      diabetes, stroke and myocardial infarction.

      Exenatide (ByettaÂ®) is a GLP-1 homologue that was FDA approved for treatment of type 2
      diabetes in 2005. It also decreases the rate of gastric emptying and increases satiety and
      has been shown to cause weight loss in some people. Exenatide may improve insulin
      sensitivity and satiety in patients with hypothalamic obesity but without the risks of
      bariatric surgery. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with exenatide will lead to
      weight loss in patients with hypothalamic obesity.
