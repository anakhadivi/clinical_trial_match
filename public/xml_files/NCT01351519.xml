  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study subjects will be administered a single oral dose of Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA)
      prior to surgical resection of their brain tumor.  The ALA ultimately causes brain tumor
      tissue to fluoresce or light up under ultraviolet light.  During surgery an ultraviolet
      light in the microscope chain will be turned on.  The tumor tissue will fluoresce bright
      pink allowing the surgeon to more easily differentiate tumor tissue from normal brain
      tissue.  The aim of the study is to determine whether ALA and fluorescent visualization of
      tumor tissue improves the surgeon's ability to completely resect or remove the brain tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study and all subjects will receive open label Aminolevulinic Acid in a
      dose of 20mg/kg given orally 3 hours prior to surgery.  Brain tumors will be resected with
      the aid of ultraviolet light to visualize the tumor.  After surgery an MRI will be done to
      determine whether the tumor has been completely or partially resected.  All subjects will be
      followed for safety.  All subjects will be followed closely by clinical examination and by
      MRI to monitor for disease recurrence.
