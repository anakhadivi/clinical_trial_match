      This is a multicenter, open-label, ascending-dose trial of the safety and tolerability of
      increasing, single doses of Toca 511, a Retroviral Replicating Vector (RRV), administered
      transcranially to subjects with recurrent high grade glioma (rHGG) who have undergone
      surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide.  Approximately 3-4 weeks
      following injection of the RRV, 6-day courses of treatment with oral 5-FC will commence and
      will be repeated monthly for up to 6 cycles.

    <textblock>
      There is an ongoing, intensive search for novel therapies to improve the prognosis of
      patients with the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer, glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM).  Gene transfer is one such approach.  Early gene-transfer studies with
      replication incompetent vectors showed this approach to be generally safe, but ineffective
      due to limited transduction of the tumor.  More recently gene transfer has been attempted
      with oncolytic, replicating viruses.  However these viruses are rapidly cleared by the
      immune system. To overcome these shortcomings of previous gene transfer protocols, Toca 511
      has been developed utilizing a Retroviral Replicating Vector (RRV). This platform has the
      following potential advantages: 1) The vector only infects dividing cells, 2) The virus
      stably integrates into the genome of the tumor cells allowing for the potential for
      long-term control of the tumor, 3) The virus is not intrinsically oncolytic and is not
      cleared from the tumor by the immune system, and 4) The virus has been engineered to express
      the prodrug-activator, cytosine deaminase (CD), a gene that catalyzes the intracellular
      conversion of the antifungal drug, 5-FC (flucytosine) to the cytotoxic drug 5-FU.  In both
      xenograft and syngeneic intracranial mouse tumor models the Toca 511/5-FC combination was
      able to significantly increase the survival of treated animals.  The goal of the current
      trial is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Toca 511 administered intratumorally to
      patients with recurrent GBM followed by cyclic treatment with the prodrug 5-FC.

      This is a multicenter, open-label, ascending-dose trial of the safety and tolerability of
      increasing, single doses of Toca 511 administered transcranially to subjects with rHGG who
      have undergone surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide.  The study
      will be conducted in 2 parts.  Part one will study ascending, single doses of Toca 511
      delivered via stereotactic, transcranial injection into the tumor.  Approximately 3-4 weeks
      later subjects will undergo a baseline Gd-MRI exam and then begin treatment with oral 5-FC
      administered for 6 consecutive days.  If tolerated, these 6-day courses of 5-FC will be
      repeated every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. Subjects will undergo Gd-MRI scanning every 8 weeks. In
      part 2 of the study, 9 additional subjects will be studied at the highest dose of Toca 511
      found in part one to be safe and well tolerated.  Each subject will receive a single,
      transcranial injection of Toca 511.  Approximately 3-4 weeks later subjects will undergo a
      baseline Gd-MRI exam and then begin treatment with oral 5-FC administered for 6 consecutive
      days.  If tolerated, these 6-day courses of 5-FC will be repeated every 4 weeks for 6
      cycles.  Subjects will undergo Gd-MRI scanning every 8 weeks.  Tumor response will be
      assessed using the Macdonald criteria.
