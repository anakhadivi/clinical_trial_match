  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic
      astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults.  This group
      of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival
      durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy consists of
      either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both.  All patients experience a
      recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy
      are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival.  It is unknown if
      currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). The
      investigators have shown in a previous phase I trial that a single Superselective
      Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective
      in the treatment of recurrent GBM.  Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an
      extension of that trial in that the investigators seek to test the hypothesis that repeated
      dosing of intra-arterial Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent
      malignant glioma.  By achieving the aims of this study the investigators will also determine
      if IV therapy with Bevacizumab should be combined with repeated selected intra-arterial
      Bevacizumab to improve progression free and overall survival.  The investigators expect that
      this project will provide important information regarding the utility of repeated SIACI
      Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to
      the patients in the near future.

    <textblock>
      1. Non-technical research plan: The current standard of care for recurring GBM is for
      patients to receive Bevacizumab (Bevacizumab) intravenously (IV) at 10mg/kg with CPT-11
      (Irinotecan) every two weeks until their tumor grows more than 25%.  At that point, these
      patients are deemed treatment failures and are given another treatment.  Because of the
      blood brain barrier (BBB) where IV drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get
      into the brain, no one knows for sure if these IV drugs actually get into the brain after
      infusion.  The investigators have recently completed a Phase I clinical trial that has shown
      that SIACI of Bevacizumab is safe and effective up to a dose of 10mg/kg in patients with
      recurrent malignant glioma.  This two arm open-label, randomized trial is a follow up study
      to that trial and will ask two simple questions:  Is it safe to deliver repeated doses
      (every three months) of Bevacizumab intra-arterially using these super selective
      intra-arterial delivery techniques?  Is it necessary to combine this IA regimen of treatment
      with biweekly IV Bevacizumab in order to improve progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS)?  Information from this trial will yield important answers to the durability
      and efficacy of this delivery technique and may radically change the way chemotherapy is
      given to the patients with brain tumors.

      Current Standard of Care:

      Day 0:  Intravenous Bevacizumab (10mg/kg) and CPT-11 Day 14, 28 (and every two weeks
      thereafter):  Intravenous Bevacizumab and CPT-11

      Experimental portion of this proposal: This trial will have two experimental arms that will
      be open labeled and non-randomized:

      ARM 1:

      Day 0:  Intraarterial Bevacizumab single dose (15mg/kg) after Mannitol to open the blood
      brain barrier Day 28 Intravenous Bevacizumab (10mg/kg) every two weeks thereafter until
      disease progression on MRI scan.

      If progression occurs, repeat Intraarterial Bevacizumab single dose (15mg/kg) to area of
      progression and wait 28 days and then restart Intravenous Bevacizumab (10mg/kg) every two
      weeks thereafter until progression on MRI scan.

      Repeat Cycle

      ARM 2:

      Day 0:  Intraarterial Bevacizumab single dose (15mg/kg) after Mannitol to open the blood
      brain barrier Day 28 No IV Bevacizumab treatment If MRI shows progression then repeat
      Intraarterial Bevacizumab single dose (15mg/kg) to area of progression Repeat Cycle

      Therefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:

        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol
           25%; 3-10 mL/s for 30seconds) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier.  This
           technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA
           delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.  The investigators have used this
           without complication in the 15 patients from the Phase I protocol as well.

        2. To treat patients with one of two arms with repeated intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of
           Bevacizumab for patients with recurring or relapsing high grade glioma.  Each arm gets
           IA delivery with one arm getting IV Bevacizumab biweekly as well and the other arm not
           getting intervening IV therapy.  In each arm, IA therapy is repeated when MRI shows
           progression.  Persistent progression after three intra-arterial chemotherapies would
           remove the patient from the trial Inclusion criteria:   Males or females, 18 years of
           age, with documented histologic diagnosis of relapsed or refractory glioblastoma
           multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma
           (AOA).  The lesion must be &lt;3.5cm in greatest diameter and circumscribed to fall within
           an area targetable by IA therapy.  The patient's KPS &gt; 70 and the patient must have a
           life expectancy greater than 12 weeks.

      Both hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity will be determined and scored according to the
      NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).  Monitoring will be conducted by post procedure
      serial history, neurological and physical examinations together with MRI will be performed
      every cycle or approximately once a month. The following subjects will be taken off
      protocol: those with progressive disease after three cycles of IA therapy; those who
      experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT will be defined as Grade III or worse
      non-hematologic and hematologic toxicity or Grade II or worse CNS hemorrhage.  Follow-up
      will continue until disease progression or death. Survival will be measured from the time of
      the first dose of IA BevacizumabÂ® (given at the start of each treatment cycle).

      This treatment may be harmful to a fetus if you were pregnant.  If you are a female of
      childbearing age,  you will be asked to practice birth control methods while participating
      in this research study and for 3 months following your treatment.  These methods include
      oral contraceptives, contraceptive shots, and barrier methods, such as condom use, sponges,
      and diaphragms.  Fertile males are required to use these barrier methods
