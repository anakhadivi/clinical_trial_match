  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if &quot;humanized 3F8&quot; (Hu3F8) is safe for treating
      neuroblastoma and other cancers. A phase 1 study means the investigators are trying to find
      out what side effects happen when higher and higher doses of a drug are used.

      The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, Hu3F8 has on cancer. The
      amount of Hu3F8 that patients gets will depend on when they start treatment on this study.
      The investigators also want to find out more about how Hu3F8 works and how effective it is
      in attacking the disease. Hu3F8 is an experimental drug, which means it has not yet been
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of this disease.

    <description>At least 3 patients will be studied at each dosage level and dose escalations will only be carried out if 0/3 or &lt; or = to 1/6 patients have dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). At least six patients will be studied at the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD).</description>

    <description>Pharmacokinetics will be measured by serial blood sampling following the iv doses of hu3F8 during cycle 1. Serum hu3F8 will be measured at the following times after infusion of the first hu3F8 infusion during the first cycle: 0, 5 min, 3h, 6-8h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96, 120h 168h, 216h and 264 h and will also include peak hu3F8 level after infusion for each of the two hu3F8 injections during the first cycle. Peak hu3F8 level at 5 minutes after hu3F8 infusion on days 3 and 5. Pre-treatment and at 5 min after infusion will also be measured for all hu3F8 infusions during all other cycles.</description>

    <description>For neuroblastoma, anti-tumor activity will be measured by INRC.61 For other solid tumors, the response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1.62</description>

    <description>Pts can be treated on 2 different schedules: Pts following a 2 doses/cycle schedule (pts who were enrolled &amp; started treatment prior to A(8)), 1 cycle has 2 days of IV hu3F8 tx, given approximately 7 days apart. Pts following a 3 doses/cycle schedule, 1 cycle has 3 days of IV hu3F8 tx, given on days 1, 3 &amp; 5. Cycles are 21 days &amp; can be repeated up to a total of 12 cycles. Evaluations before, during &amp; after tx are summarized in table. In addition, to further study the side effect of pain, pts will be asked to assess their pain on the days of tx with hu3F8 at 3 different time points: (a) prior to commencement of hu3F8, (b) at least 1 during the acute pain episode when rescue pain medication doses are usually required &amp; (c) prior to discharge from the Pediatric Day Hospital. Pts who complete the 12 cycles of tx with no disease progression &amp; if clinically indicated are eligible to receive additional cycles of tx for up to 1 additional year. Breaks between cycles can be up to 8 weeks.</description>
