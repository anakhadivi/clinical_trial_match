  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2005, The University of Alabama at Birmingham established a NIDDK-funded,
      interdisciplinary center of excellence in PKD-related research, with specific emphasis on
      recessive PKD. In the previous Core Center award period, we developed a Core Resource to
      capture clinical and mutational data for ARPKD patients (&quot;Core A: ARPKD Clinical and Genetic
      Resource&quot;, NCT00575705). However, studies in the last several years have demonstrated that
      ARPKD and other single gene disorders characterized by renal cystic disease and extra-renal
      phenotypes share numerous pathogenic features. In the current competitively- renewed Center,
      we have expanded this Core resource to include other hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases.

      Goals for the Core A: The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Translational Resource are:

        1. - Clinical Database:

           â€¢ Expand our comprehensive Clinical Database to include information from all patients
           who meet the inclusion criteria for hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases.

        2. - Mutational Database:

             -  Test children with ARPKD and other hepato/renal fibrocystic disease to identify
                genetic mutations, establish a DNA bank for patients with hepato/renal fibrocystic
                diseases and develop a Mutational Database. This Database will be capable of
                linking clinical and mutational information via a unique identifier in a
                searchable format to facilitate genetic research (e.g. genotype-phenotype
                correlations, new disease gene studies, and modifier gene studies), translational
                studies, and clinical trials.

                3- Tissue Resource:

             -  Much of the research that is performed on diseases of the kidney, including
                recessive genetic diseases, requires human tissue from both affected as well as
                non-affected (controls) individuals. In this Core Resource, we are establishing an
                independent tissue resource which would supply investigators throughout North
                America with samples of hepato/renal fibrocystic disease affected tissues for
                studies of these disorders.

                4- Educational Resource:

             -  Expand our multi-media, web-based resource to provide a reliable up-to-date, and
                comprehensive informational resource for ARPKD and Hepato/Renal Diseases families,
                their physicians, and genetic counselors.

      All the information regarding participation in &quot;Core A: The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic
      Diseases Translational Resource&quot; is available at: http://www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The entry portal for Core A is designed so that physicians who contact the CLIA-certified
      UAB Medical Genomics Laboratory (MGL) requesting information about PKHD1 testing and any
      patient/parent/legally authorized representative looking for information online about any of
      the hepato-renal diseases included in this study will be directed to the UAB Hepato/Renal
      Fibrocystic Disease Translational Resource website http://www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/.

      The Informed Consent for the Clinical Database and Information for the participant will be
      posted on the website (http://www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/) for review by potential
      participants and follow-up discussions with the PI and/or Research Nurse Coordinator. In
      addition, materials in paper format can be sent to interested potential participants upon
      request.

      Two key elements will be required for patient enrollment: 1) certification that informed
      consent has been obtained, and 2) participant and physician contact information form
      completed by the participant.

      The UAB release of information form, information for the physician and instructions on how
      to enter data will be posted in the website available to the physician.

      This study does not provide free genetic testing. Clinical genetic testing is available via
      UAB Medical Genomics Laboratory (CLIA and CAP approved) as a fee-for-service. In special
      cases (eg. presenting at an older age, mainly with liver or pancreatic disease) contact Dr.
      Guay-Woodford at lgw@uab.edu.

      Once receipt of the requisite items is confirmed, the following actions will proceed:

        1. Each participant will be assigned a unique code identifier in the database and a
           clinician-specific web field will be opened for the participant identifier.

        2. The participant/parents will confirm the name of their clinician to the database and
           notify their physician and/or genetic counselor (clinicians) of their intent to
           participate in this study.

        3. The clinician will access the Physician Link on the website and follow the instructions
           about how to post data to the website. Once this is done, the name of the patient will
           be deleted from the online database and only the unique identifier will be used. Each
           clinician permitted to access this website will be tracked with a login procedure that
           includes a process to verify who is entering the system. Clinical data will be provided
           by the participant's physician through the web-based entry system, coded with a unique
           identifier, and entered into the secure Clinical Database as an initial visit data (F01
           or primary data form) and annual follow up (F11 or follow up form). Data entry will
           last the duration of this study. No names or initials will be collected on these data
           forms, but gender and date of birth (which will be converted to age and only the month
           and year will be kept on file) will be requested. The physician will not receive a
           monetary incentive for entering data.

        4. Blood samples for diagnostic testing (with signed clinical genetic testing consent)
           will be sent to the UAB MGL. The UAB MGL will perform standardized fee for service
           testing for PKHD1 mutations. The clinical result will be reported to the patient's
           physician/genetic counselor. As needed, genetic counseling services can be made
           available through the UAB Department of Genetics (fee for service).

        5. Blood samples for research purposes will come directly to the research lab from
           patients/families signing the study consent and agreeing to have DNA extraction/EBV
           transformation/or both. Adult and children participants need two tsp of blood and
           infants need one tsp of blood.

        6. This study does not provide free genetic testing. Clinical genetic testing is available
           via UAB Medical Genomics Laboratory (CLIA and CAP approved) as a fee-for-service. The
           result of the genetic testing will be entered into the Mutational Database if the
           participant or their representative provides consent to participate in the Database.

        7. Our center can be notified directly by a local physician authorized by the patient or
           the patient can contact our center directly to donate hepato/renal fibrocystic disease
           tissue. The research coordinator will contact the possible participant/parent/legally
           authorized representative to discuss the study and their willingness to participate in
           this research. If the study consents are signed, the research coordinator will call the
           center/pathologist, sending the sample and provide them with instructions on how to
           prepare and ship sample. On arrival to Dr. Guay-Woodford's lab, the sample will be
           de-identified and coded with the participant's unique identifier and transported to the
           UAB Tissue Collection and Banking Facility.
