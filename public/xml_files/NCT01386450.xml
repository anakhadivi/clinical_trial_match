      Background:

      - AZD6244 is an experimental drug designed to prevent tumor growth and shrink existing
      tumors. It has been studied in adults with cancer, but it has not been studied in children
      with cancer. Researchers want to see if AZD6244 is a safe and effective treatment for older
      children and young adults who have gliomas (brain tumors) that have not responded to
      standard treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of AZD6244 in older children and young adults who
      have gliomas that have not responded to standard treatments.

      Eligibility:

      - People between 12 and 21 years of age who have gliomas that have not responded to standard
      treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also
           have blood tests and tumor imaging studies. Those in the study may also have their
           spinal fluid tested to see whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the nervous
           system.

        -  Participants will take AZD6244 as a capsule. It must be swallowed whole on an empty
           stomach twice a day for 28 days. Those in the study will have up to 13 cycles (4 weeks
           each) of treatment (1 year).

        -  Participants will keep a diary to record doses taken and any side effects of the
           treatment.

        -  Participants will have frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

      Background

      Low Grade Gliomas are among the most common primary CNS neoplasms of childhood.

      Debulking surgery and chemotherapy are temporizing strategies that ideally allow tumor
      stabilization until definitive radiation maybe used. Radiation therapy is associated with
      long term morbidity.

      Patients with high risk features such as hypothalamic location and young age at diagnosis
      have shown overall survival as low as 60% at 10 years despite multimodal therapies.

      AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) is a potent, selective, orally-available, and non-ATP competitive
      small molecule inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, MEK-1/2.

      Overexpression of growth factors or growth factor receptors involved in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
      pathway and activating genetic mutations of the signaling proteins may lead to uncontrolled
      proliferation and tumor formation.

      Primary Objectives

      To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommend a Phase II dose of AZD6244 in
      children with recurrent or refractory low-grade glioma. Completed April 29, 2013

      To describe the toxicity profile and define the dose limiting toxicity of AZD6244 in
      children with recurrent or refractory low-grade glioma. Completed April 29, 2013

      Phase II

      To assess sustained response rate of AZD6244 administered at 25 mg/m (2)/ dose bid, in a
      single arm Phase II setting in patients in strata based on NF-1 status and presence or
      absence of BRAF aberrations, specifically BRAF (V600E) mutations and/ or BRAF KIAA1549
      fusion identified by IHC and FISH.

      Eligibility

      Age: Patient must be greater than or equal to 12 and less than or equal to 21 years of age.

      Tumor: Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of low grade gliomas (WHO Grades
      I&amp;  II). Patients with optic pathway gliomas are eligible with clinical and/or radiographic
      evidence of progression.

      Performance status: Karnofsky Performance Scale (if greater than 16 yrs) or Lansky
      Performance Score (if less than 16 years) greater than or equal to 60% assessed within two
      weeks prior to Registration.

      Prior/Concurrent therapy: The patient has received prior therapy with radiation prior to
      study registration. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all
      prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

      Design

      Patients will receive AZD6244 25mg/m(2)/ dose orally twice daily approximately 12 hours
      apart.  Four consecutive weeks will constitute one course and subsequent courses will
      immediately follow, with no break in the administration of the drug.

      AZD6244 should be taken on an empty stomach either 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.
      AZD6244 capsules should be taken with water only.
