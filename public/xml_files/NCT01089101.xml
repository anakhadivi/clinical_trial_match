    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of selumetinib and how well
      it works in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory low grade glioma.
      Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommend a Phase II dose of AZD6244
      (selumetinib) in children with recurrent or refractory low-grade glioma (phase I completed
      as of April 29, 2013). (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicity profile and define the dose
      limiting toxicity of AZD6244 in children with recurrent or refractory low-grade glioma
      (phase I completed as of April 29, 2013). (Phase I) III. To study the safety of the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended a Phase II dose (RP2D) of AZD6244 as determined based on
      safety data from children &gt;= 12 years of age in children &lt; 12 years of age. If the MTD/RP2D
      of the older children is too toxic for the younger children, we will de-escalate to one dose
      level below and study the safety of that dose in the younger age cohort (phase I completed
      as of April 29, 2013). (Phase I) IV. To assess the sustained response rate of AZD6244
      administered at 25 mg/m^2/dose twice daily (BID), in patients assigned to strata based on
      NF-1 status and presence or absence of BRAF aberrations, specifically BRAF V600E mutations
      and/or BRAF KIAA1549 fusion identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH), respectively. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the inter- and intra-patient variability in AZD6244 pharmacokinetics
      administered on this schedule and to assess the influence of patient specific covariates
      (including concomitant drug therapy) on AZD6244 pharmacokinetics (phase I completed as of
      April 29, 2013). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the feasibility of collecting pre-trial tumor
      samples and the feasibility of using in situ hybridization assay to identify BRAF
      aberrations in available tumor specimens (phase I completed as of April 29, 2013). (Phase I)
      III. To determine if pre-trial tumor samples show the biochemical signature that indicates
      activation of the MAPK pathway (phase I completed as of April 29, 2013). (Phase I) IV. To
      describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the tumors before and after
      treatment and to explore the diffusion changes in the tumors before and after treatment to
      determine if there is an early diffusion indicator of response (phase I completed as of
      April 29, 2013). (Phase I) V. Within the constraints of a Phase I trial, to document
      antitumor activity of treatment with AZD6244, as measured by objective responses and
      progression-free survival (PFS) (phase I completed as of April 29, 2013). (Phase I) VI. To
      explore the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in AZD6244 metabolizing enzymes and transporters
      and relate these polymorphisms to AZD6244 pharmacokinetics (phase I completed as of April
      29, 2013). (Phase I) VII. To estimate the PFS distributions associated with AZD6244
      treatment separately in patients assigned to the four strata and for strata 1, 3 and 4
      combined. (Phase II) VIII. To explore correlations between BRAF aberrations and treatment
      response and PFS in patients for whom relevant biology data is available. (Phase II) IX. To
      assess mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) aberrations by a combination of whole-exome
      and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing. (Phase II) X. To characterize the inter- and
      intra-patient variability in AZD6244 pharmacokinetics administered on this schedule at the
      MTD/RP2D. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study (completed as of April 29, 2013) followed
      by a phase II study.

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
