  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and utility of 5-aminolevulinic acid
      (ALA) for identifying your tumor during surgery.  5-ALA is not FDA approved at this time.
      When the investigators remove the tumor from your brain, it is important that they remove
      all of the tumor and not remove parts of normal brain.  Sometimes this can be difficult
      because the tumor can look like normal brain.  In some brain tumors, 5-ALA can make the
      tumors glow red under blue light.  This may make it easier for your doctor to take out all
      of the tumor from your brain.  The purpose of this study is to:

        -  make sure that 5-ALA helps the doctor remove more of the tumor, and

        -  make sure 5-ALA does not cause any side effects. If you do not want to participate in
           this study, your doctor(s) will still do their best to remove all of the tumor in your
           brain.  Whether or not you join this study will not change your treatment for your
           brain tumor.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a clinically documented primary brain tumor for which resection is
             clinically indicated. Individuals with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent
             malignant gliomas will be considered eligible for the study. Sixty (60) newly
             diagnosed and recurrent malignant gliomas will be enrolled in this study.  The
             anticipated histology at resection should include:  Anaplastic astrocytoma
             (10002224), Anaplastic ependymoma, Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, Astrocytoma
             malignant NOS (10003572), Glioblastoma (10018336), Glioblastoma multiforme
             (10018337), or  Gliosarcoma (10018340).

          -  Prior therapy is not a consideration in protocol entry.

          -  Age 18-80.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Life expectancy is not a consideration for protocol entry.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        Leukocytes   &gt;3,000/mL Absolute neutrophil count  &gt;1,500/mL Platelets   &gt;100,000/mL Total
        bilirubin   within normal institutional limits AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT)  &lt;2.5 X institutional
        upper limit of normal Creatinine   within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine
        clearance  &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional
        normal.

          -  The effects of Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy is not an exclusion criterion.

          -  Tumors of or involving the midline, basal ganglia, or brain stem as assessed by MRI

          -  Patients may not be receiving any experimental therapies.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Patients should refrain from use of other
             potential phototoxic substances (e.g. tetracyclines, sulfonamides,fluoroquinolones,
             hypericin extracts) for 72 h.

          -  Personal or family history of porphorias.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.Pregnant women are excluded from this study because aminolevulinic
             acid (ALA) is of unknown teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with aminolevulinic acid (ALA), breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with aminolevulinic acid (ALA)

          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Both men and women and members of all ethnic
             groups are eligible for this trial.
