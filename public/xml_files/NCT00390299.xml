      RATIONALE: The measles virus, that has been changed in a certain way, may kill tumor cells
      without damaging normal cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of viral therapy in
      treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of intratumoral and/or resection cavity
           administration of a recombinant, attenuated Edmonston B vaccine strain derivative of
           measles virus genetically engineered to produce human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in
           patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this oncolytic virus in these patients.

        -  Determine viral gene expression at each dose level as manifested by CEA titers in
           patients treated with this oncolytic virus.

        -  Assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence after
           intratumoral administration of this oncolytic virus.

        -  Assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor efficacy of this vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 sequential
      treatment groups.

        -  Group 1 (resection cavity administration): Patients undergo en block resection of their
           tumor (after confirming diagnosis) on day 1, followed by recombinant measles virus
           encoding human carcinoembryonic antigen (MV-CEA) administered into the resection cavity
           over 10 minutes.

        -  Group 2 (intratumoral and resection cavity administration): Patients undergo placement
           of a catheter within the tumor, followed by MV-CEA administration into the tumor
           through the catheter over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo en block resection of
           their tumor with computer-assisted stereotactic techniques on day 5, followed by MV-CEA
           administered around the tumor bed.

      In both groups, cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of MV-CEA until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD in group 1 has been
      determined, patients are assigned to group 2. The MTD in group 1 is used to determine the
      starting dose in group 2. At least 10 patients are treated at the MTD determined in group 2.

      Biopsy specimen, resected tumor, normal tissue, and peripheral blood are collected during
      study for immunologic and biomarker correlative studies, including analysis of CD46 receptor
      levels (by immunohistochemistry [IHC]), measles virus N protein (by IHC), measles and viral
      gene expression and replication (by in situ hybridization), CEA monitoring (by immunoassay),
      measles virus N mRNA (by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), and measles virus
      immunity. Assessments of immune competence and peripheral response to viral administration
      are also performed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
