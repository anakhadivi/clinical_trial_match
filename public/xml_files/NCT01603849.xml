  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the first cause of death among cancer patients. Non Small Cell lung cancer
      (NSCLS) represents about 80-85% of the cases. Of this, about 80% presents with locally
      advanced or metastatic disease.  Important to mention the number of patients that progress
      or recur in central nervous system (CNS). It has been reported that patients with
      adenocarcinoma, who are under 60 years and with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are
      in the highest risk to develop brain metastasis.  In small cell lung cancer, treatment with
      prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is the standard of care in patients without
      progression after locoregional or systemic treatment because the proven benefit in overall
      survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). However, in NSCLC PCI has not been able
      to prove any survival benefit, only in CNS PFS, probably because there is no trial, to our
      knowledge, of PCI in NSCLC that include only the specific group of patients considered in
      high risk of developing brain metastasis.

      Objectives:

        1. To obtain a greater PFS and CNS PFS in patients with NSCLC treated with PCI after
           locoregional or systemic treatment.

        2. Evaluate the benefit in OS in the specific group of patients who are at increased risk
           of developing brain metastasis

        3. Evaluate quality of life and mental function before and after treatment  with PCI and
           compare it with patients in the observation group.

      Methods: One hundred and twenty eight patients with locally advanced or metastatic (except
      CNS metastasis) NSCLC will be included and randomized to receive either observation or PCI
      25 Gy in 10 fractions Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) once the initial treatment has been
      completed and progression of the disease ruled out.
