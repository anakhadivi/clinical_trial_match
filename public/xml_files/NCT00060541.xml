      This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of neurological
      disorders that may require surgery.  The protocol is not designed to test new treatments;
      rather, patients will receive standard care.  The study is designed to: 1) allow NINDS's
      Surgical Neurology Branch staff to learn more about changes that cause nervous system
      disorders, 2) train physicians in the evaluation and treatment of these disorders; and 3)
      establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for other NINDS protocols.  (Participants
      in this protocol will not be required to join another study; the decision will be
      voluntary.)

      Patients of all ages with a disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
      or pituitary gland that may require surgery for diagnosis or treatment may be eligible for
      this study.  In some cases surgery will not be needed.  Candidates will be screened with a
      medical history and physical examination.

      Participants may undergo tests, medial treatment, or surgical treatment to help diagnose or
      treat their condition.  In most cases, care provided at the NIH will be limited to
      evaluation and surgery.  Procedures may include laboratory tests, imaging tests, such as
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, angiograms, and other
      procedures to confirm the patient's diagnosis or help guide treatment.  Patients who require
      surgery will be offered standard surgical care at NIH.  Those whose procedure includes
      removal of tissues or fluids for diagnostic studies will be asked to allow a portion of the
      tissue to be used for research purposes, including analysis for gene and protein
      abnormalities that may be involved in causing the disorder or in influencing the patient's
      response to treatment.  Blood samples will also be drawn for research.

      Objective:  This protocol is designed to allow evaluation of patients with a variety of
      neurosurgical disorders for purposes of providing standard expert care and physician
      training.

      Study Population:  Patients 4 years of age and older with neurosurgical-related conditions
      are eligible for this protocol.  The investigators will select patients based on the most
      appropriate needs for purposes of SNB and NINDS training.

      Study Design:  This is an observational study for training.  Patients will receive standard
      evaluation and treatment for their condition.  A physician, physician assistant, or nurse
      practitioner will obtain a medical history and perform a physical and neurological
      examination. Clinical evaluation may include laboratory and radiological studies designed to
      aid in diagnosis or differential diagnosis of the patient's condition or to facilitate
      treatment.  The evaluations may take place in the outpatient clinic areas or in the
      inpatient units.  Some patients will receive standard-of-care medical or surgical treatment
      for their disorder. Tissue or blood samples removed during standard treatment, if not needed
      for care of the patient, may be used for research.

      Outcome Measures:  No additional research outcome measures will be tracked in this study.
      All outcomes will be those of standard clinical evaluation and treatment.
