  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prodrug, 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), has been shown to lead to intracellular
      accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in high grade malignant gliomas in the brain. On
      imaging, this accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins helps delineate tumor borders,
      resulting in the surgeon being better able to visualize and thus able to make a complete, or
      near-complete resection of the tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which leads to intracellular accumulation of
      fluorescent porphyrins in malignant gliomas will be used under investigation for
      identification and resection of high grade gliomas. Surgery will be done using a modified
      neurosurgical microscope, with a fluorescent kit that enables switching from the
      conventional white light to a violet-blue excitation light for visualization during tumor
      resection. If deemed safe by the neurosurgeon, any area of the resection bed determined to
      be fluorescence-positive for tumor will be removed with appropriate designation of tissue
      for histopathological evaluation.  After this resection, additional fluorescence images will
      be obtained and the process repeated until the image is negative for tumor. At all times,
      the decision to resect will be limited by clinical judgment of safety.

      The desire is that a more complete resection will occur due to the surgeon's ability to
      better visualize and distinguish between tumor and normal tissue, and thus be able to remove
      as much, or most of, the tumorous tissue, resulting in a better outcome for the patient, or
      for future patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presumptive diagnosis of high grade glioma based on imaging studies, or will have
             recurrent high-grade gliomas that have previously undergone diagnosis (astrocytoma,
             oligodendroglioma, mixed oligo-astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and glioblastoma
             multiforme).  Both of these groups will be undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection.

          2. Patient age 18 to 72 years.

          3. Karnofsky performance of 60% or greater

          4. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

             Leukocytes &gt;3,000/μL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/μL Platelets &gt;100,000/μL Total
             bilirubin  within normal institutional limits AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt;2.5 X
             institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine within normal institutional limits or
             Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with    creatinine levels above
             institutional normal.

          5. The effects of Aminolevulinic Acid  (ALA) on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             Therefore, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation.

          6. Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document or have a parent or guardian with the ability to understand
             and the willingness to sign the written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to aminolevulinic acid (ALA).

          2. Subjects with a history or family history of Porphyrias

          3. Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          4. Pregnancy.
