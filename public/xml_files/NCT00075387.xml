      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and
      etoposide phosphate, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Combining more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving them in
      different ways may kill more tumor cells. Chemoprotective drugs, such as sodium thiosulfate,
      may protect blood platelets from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying combination chemotherapy and sodium
      thiosulfate to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating
      patients with high-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of delayed administration of high-dose sodium thiosulfate on
           platelet counts in patients with high-grade glioma undergoing treatment with
           carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide or etoposide phosphate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of delayed administration of high-dose sodium thiosulfate on
           granulocyte and erythrocyte counts in patients treated with this chemotherapy regimen.

        -  Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this chemotherapy regimen with or
           without delayed high-dose sodium thiosulfate.

        -  Determine hearing changes at higher frequencies in the standard testing range (i.e.,
           4,000 and 8,000 Hz) and at higher frequencies above standard testing range (i.e., 9,000
           and 16,000 Hz) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      histology type (glioblastoma multiforme vs other high-grade glioma). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms (Arm 1: no STS or Arm 2: STS).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 10 minutes, etoposide phosphate IV
           over 10 minutes (or etoposide IV), and carboplatin intra-arterially over 10 minutes on
           day 1. Beginning on day 3, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once
           daily for 7-10 days until blood counts recover. Alternatively, one dose of Neulasta
           (Pegfilgrastim) instead of G-CSF 24-72 hrs after chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide, etoposide phosphate or etoposide and
           carboplatin as in arm 1. At 4 and 8 hours after carboplatin administration, patients
           receive high-dose sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes.  Then, G-CSF as in arm 1.
           Alternatively, one dose of Neulasta (Pegfilgrastim) instead of G-CSF 24-72 hrs after
           chemotherapy.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months during study treatment, and then
      within 30 days after the final study treatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
