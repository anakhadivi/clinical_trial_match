      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of anti-endoglin monoclonal
      antibody TRC105 when giving together with bevacizumab and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 and bevacizumab, may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105
      together with bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TRC105 (anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody
      TRC105) combined with bevacizumab in this patient population. (Phase I) II. To assess the
      safety and adverse events of TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab in this patient
      population. (Phase II) III. To determine the efficacy of TRC105 in combination with
      bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma as measured by progression-free survival and compare
      it with the efficacy of bevacizumab alone in this patient population. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients who are progression free at 6 months, treated with
      TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab as compared to bevacizumab alone. (Phase II) II. To
      assess the overall survival of patients treated with TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab
      compared to bevacizumab alone. (Phase II) III. To compare the impact of the treatment on the
      patients quality of life (QOL) using the EORTC Quality of Life QLQ-C15-PAL and QLQ-BN20
      Patient Questionnaires. (Phase II) IV. To estimate patient recommendations for study
      participation to others using the Was It Worth It (WIWI) Questionnaire. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TRC105. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the immunogenicity
      of TRC105. (Phase I) III. To determine the relationship between tumor biomarkers,
      circulating biomarkers of vascular response and vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF)/VEGFR single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in predicting efficacy and/or toxicity of
      treatment. (Phase II) IV. To assess the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging
      including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a predictor of response and survival.
      (Phase II) V. To assess the utility of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI as a predictor of
      response to bevacizumab with or without TRC105. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of anti-endoglin monoclonal
      antibody TRC105 followed by a randomized phase II study.

      Phase I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and
      anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 IV over 1-4 hours on days 8 and 11 of course 1 and
      days 1 and 8 of course 2 and all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Phase II: Patients are stratified according to age (&gt; 70 vs =&lt; 70) and resection at
      recurrence (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and anti-endoglin
      monoclonal antibody TRC105 IV over 1-4 hours on days 8 and 11 of course 1 and days 1 and 8
      of course 2 and all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. Courses repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
