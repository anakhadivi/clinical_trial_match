  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a specialized imaging technique using MRI called
      multi-exponential T2 component analysis can reliably differentiate between normal brain and
      brain tumour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing methods of contouring tumours for radiation therapy involve manual interpretations
      of qualitative diagnostic images. These methods, being qualitative, do not offer a
      consistent and reproducible platform for contouring, making it difficult to evaluate the
      effects of contouring choices on treatment outcome. T2 component analysis in MRI has the
      potential to offer a quantitive basis for identifying tumor tissue- this potential is
      investigated in this pilot study.
