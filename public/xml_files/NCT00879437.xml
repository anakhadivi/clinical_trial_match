  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are few effective treatments for the following aggressive brain tumors:
      glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, gliomatosis cerebri, gliosarcoma, or
      brainstem glioma. Surgery and radiation can generally slow down these aggressive brain
      tumors, but in the majority of patients, these tumors will start growing again in 6-12
      months. Adding chemotherapy drugs to surgery and radiation does not clearly improve the cure
      rate of children with malignant gliomas.

      The investigators are conducting this study to see if the combination of valproic acid and
      bevacizumab (also known as AvastinTM) with surgery and radiation will shrink these brain
      tumors more effectively and improve the chance of cure.

      With the exception of patients with brainstem gliomas, all patients should have the maximal
      surgical resection that can be safely performed prior to study entry. Submission of frozen
      tumor is strongly encouraged. After recovery from neurosurgery, all patients will start
      valproic acid and radiation therapy.

      Valproic Acid (VPA): VPA will be started at 15 mg/kg/day divided into three doses a day,
      ideally 48 hours prior to first day of radiation therapy, but no later than the first day of
      radiation therapy. Patients may also begin VPA sooner if they have post-operative seizures
      and require an anti-convulsant.

      Radiation Phase: Radiation therapy should begin within 30 days of definitive surgery or
      radiographic diagnosis, whichever is the later date. Date of surgery or radiographic
      diagnosis is considered day 1, and radiation should start no later than day 31. VPA will be
      continued daily without interruption during radiation therapy. VPA doses will be adjusted in
      increments of 5 mg/kg/day every 3-5 days to achieve and maintain trough concentrations
      between 85 to 115 mcg/ml. During this time patients will receive standard radiation therapy.

      Post Radiation Phase: Patients will continue to receive VPA as during radiation. If
      necessary, patients who had delays in radiation (e.g., secondary to schedule holidays or the
      need to have a new mask made) will complete their radiotherapy to the total prescribed
      protocol dose.

      Maintenance Phase: Maintenance therapy will begin 4 weeks after completion of radiation or
      week 11, whichever comes first.

      Patients will continue VPA daily during maintenance therapy. All patients will start
      bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg by vein every two weeks, at the start of maintenance therapy.
      Maintenance therapy will continue uninterrupted if all laboratory tests continue to meet
      on-study criteria. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, patients
      will continue to receive protocol treatment for a maximum total duration of two years
      (including the radiation phase).

                       for females

             Note: The threshold creatinine values in this table were derived from the Schwartz
             formula for estimating GFR (Schwartz et al. J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) utilizing child
             length and stature data published by the CDC.

          8. Amylase and lipase less than or equal to 2 times institutional ULN for age.

          9. Patients must not have a prolonged PT or PTT (greater than 1.2 times the
             institutional upper limit of normal), and the INR must be less than 1.5.

         10. MRI ECHO gradient sequences are required to evaluate for the presence or absence of
             CNS hemorrhage. Patients with intra-tumoral and/or CNS hemorrhage are not eligible
             for study entry except:

               -  Patients with asymptomatic intra-tumoral hemorrhage of punctate size, at the
                  time of diagnosis, after surgery, and/or any time during protocol therapy

               -  Patients with asymptomatic post-operative hemorrhage in and/or around the
                  surgical cavity are eligible for study entry. Additional imaging studies are not
                  required, but in the event a repeat MRI is performed for clinical reasons the
                  post-operative hemorrhage must not have progressed.

         11. Patients must begin radiation therapy within 30 days of surgery or radiographic
             diagnosis, whichever is the later date.

         12. All patients and/or their legal guardians must sign a written informed consent.
             Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females of reproductive potential must not be pregnant or lactating. Males or females
             of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an
             effective contraceptive method.

             (Persantine), or any other drug that inhibits platelet function g. Anti-convulsants:
             patients on any anti-convulsant with the exception of VPA are eligible for study
             entry. It is strongly recommended that a neurology consult be obtained to enable
             discontinuation of all anti-convulsant other than VPA, whenever possible.

          4. Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.

          5. Patients with inadequately controlled systemic hypertension (SBP and/or DBP greater
             than 95th percentile for age and height)

          6. Patients with a prior history of hypertensive crisis and/or hypertensive
             encephalopathy

             If a BP measurement prior to registration is greater than 95th percentile for age and
             height, it must be rechecked and documented to be less than 95th percentile for age
             and height prior to registration. If a patient falls between the height or weight
             percentiles, site should average the value as appropriate. For patients greater than
             or equal to 18 years, use adult normal ranges for blood pressure. Patients with
             hypertension are eligible if their blood pressures become less than 95th percentile
             after anti hypertensive medications.

          7. Prior Ischemic Events: Patients with a history of stroke, myocardial infarction, or
             unstable angina within 6 months prior to registration are not eligible.

             requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months
             prior to registration will not be eligible.

          9. Patients with a history of hemoptysis, bleeding diathesis, known platelet disorder,
             or coagulopathy are not eligible.

         10. Patients with a history of abdominal fistula or GI perforation within 6 months prior

             study entry are not eligible.

         13. Patients with a history of a serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture are
             not eligible.

         14. Patients with any clinically significant systemic illness, including serious
             infection, pulmonary, hepatic, or other organ impairment, that would compromise
             tolerance and/or timely completion of protocol therapy.

        16. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
        safety monitoring requirements and/or follow-up studies of this trial.

        17. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab are not
