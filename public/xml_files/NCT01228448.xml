  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational part of this study is using a mobile PET scanner called NeuroPET to take
      images of the participants tumor while they are receiving proton radiation treatment.  This
      allows the participant to be treated and imaged in the same bed.  The information obtained
      may improve the accuracy of treatment and may help to minimize the dose delivered
      unnecessarily to healthy tissue.

      -  Depending upon when the participant enrolls in the study, they will have anywhere from
           1 to 4 in-room PET scans during proton radiation treatment. There are three groups.

        -  Group 1: A total of 24 participants in the study will have a PET scan right after their
           first radiation treatment is completed.  The scan will take 15-20 minutes.  For 5 of
           the first 19 participants, the PET scan will be performed three more times within a
           week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). For participants 20-24 the scan will be performed
           three times in the 1st, 3rd and 5th weeks.

        -  Group 2: Three participants will have a 20 minute PET scan done after the first dose of
           radiation given to the tumor.

        -  Group 3: Three participants will have a 5-20 minute PET scan done after the delivery of
           the first dose of radiation, and a 15-20 minute PET scan will be done after the
           delivery of the second dose of radiation.
