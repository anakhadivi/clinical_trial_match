      -  The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the
           chemotherapy drugs called  carboplatin and melphalan, when they are given into an
           artery, in patients  with malignant brain tumors (called embryonal and germ cell
           tumors).  The carboplatin and melphalan will be given during a procedure called
           blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD).  When used to treat this type of brain tumor,
           BBBD treatment is experimental and not approved by the FDA. Patients also receive a
           drug called sodium thiosulfate in a vein, in order to protect against
           carboplatin-induced hearing loss.

        -  Participants  will be admitted to the hospital every four weeks for approximately three
           days. The patient  will be put to sleep with general anesthesia, and a tube will be
           placed in an artery in the groin.  Mannitol (a sugar solution) will be given into the
           tube in the groin artery; this procedure is called blood-brain barrier disruption
           (BBBD).  Next, the carboplatin and melphalan chemotherapy drugs will be given into the
           artery.  The BBBD procedure is done on two days in a row, every four weeks.  The
           patient  will undergo monthly MRI scans of the head, monthly hearing evaluation, as
           well as weekly blood tests.  The patient will also have memory testing done.  Treatment
           will last for up to 12 months.

      PHASE I PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IA melphalan
      given with IA carboplatin, osmotic BBBD and delayed IV STS in subjects with recurrent or
      progressive embryonal and germ cell tumors of the CNS.

      PHASE II PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To estimate the response rate in subjects with recurrent or
      progressive CNS embryonal and germ cell tumors treated with IA carboplatin, IA melphalan,
      osmotic BBBD and delayed IV STS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To describe 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in
           subjects with recurrent or progressive CNS embryonal and germ cell tumors treated with
           IA carboplatin, IA melphalan, osmotic BBBD and delayed IV STS.

        -  To describe neuropsychological and audiology outcomes in subjects with recurrent or
           progressive CNS embryonal and germ cell tumors treated with IA carboplatin, IA
           melphalan, osmotic BBBD and delayed IV STS.

        -  To describe the overall toxicity of IA carboplatin and IA melphalan in conjunction with
           osmotic BBBD and delayed STS chemoprotection in subjects with recurrent or progressive
           CNS embryonal or germ cell tumors.
