        Eligibility Criteria

        *Tumor Types - Tumor type/location:

        Stratum A:  Newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas OR any biopsy proven
        high-grade glioma* involving the brainstem.  Patients may not have received chemotherapy
        during or after radiation.  Patients must be registered within 4-12 weeks of completing
        radiation.

        Stratum B:  Newly diagnosed, non-brainstem high-grade glioma*  Patients may not have
        received chemotherapy during or after radiation.  Patients must be registered within 4-12
        weeks of completing radiation.

        Stratum C:  Unresectable low-grade gliomas that have received at least two
        chemotherapy/biologic regimens. Patients may not have received radiation to the index
        lesion within 1 year of enrollment.

        Stratum D:  Non-brainstem high-grade gliomas* that have recurred following treatment.

        Stratum E: Newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas* or brain stem gliomas who received
        chemotherapy during radiation therapy.  Patients may not have received chemotherapy after
        radiation therapy was completed.  Patients must be registered within 4-12 weeks of
        completing radiation.

        Stratum F: Newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas with metastatic disease within the CNS
        requiring craniospinal radiation therapy.  Patients may or may not have received
        chemotherapy during radiation, but cannot have received chemotherapy after radiation
        therapy was completed.  Patients must be registered within 4-12 weeks of completing
        radiation.

          -  Eligible histologies include glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or
             gliosarcoma.  Patients with any oligodendroglioma component are NOT eligible.

          -  HLA-A2 positive based on flow cytometry.

          -  Patients in Stratum A B and E must have received standard involved field radiation
             therapy [RT] defined as fractionated external beam radiotherapy with total doses
             between 5000-6000 cGy.  Patients in these strata must be registered within 4-12 weeks
             of completing RT.

          -  Patients in Stratum F must have received craniospinal radiation.

          -  Patients must be clinically stable and off or on low-dose (no more than 0.1
             mg/kg/day, max 4 mg/day Dexamethasone) corticosteroid for at least one week prior to
             study registration.

          -  All patients must sign an IRB-approved informed consent document

          -  Patients must be  ≥ 12 months and &lt;22 years of age at the time of study registration.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of ≥ to  60; (Karnofsky if &gt; 16 years and
             Lansky if ≤ 16 years of age.

          -  Patients must have life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.

          -  documented negative serum βHCG for female patients who are post-menarchal.  Because
             the effect of the peptide-based vaccine and poly-ICLC on the fetus has not
             sufficiently been investigated, pregnant females will not be included in the study.
             Males and females must agree to use effective birth control methods during the course
             of vaccination (from the first vaccine to two weeks after the last vaccine).   Should
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.  Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of
             the mother with the peptide-based vaccine and poly-ICLC, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated in this study.

          -  Patients must be free of systemic infection at the time of registration.  Patients on
             IV antibiotic therapy must be off IV antibiotics for at least 7 days prior to
             registration.

          -  Patients with adequate organ function as measured by: Bone marrow:  ANC &gt; 1,000/µl;
             Platelets &gt; 100,000/µl (transfusion independent); absolute lymphocyte count of
             ≥500/uL; Hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dl (may be transfused).  Hepatic:  bilirubin  ≤ 1.5x
             institutional normal for age; SGPT (ALT) &lt; 3x institutional normal.

        Renal:  Serum creatinine based on age or Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt;70
        ml/min/ml/min/1.73 m²

          -  Patients on Strata C and D must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior
             therapy:  at least 3 weeks form the last dose of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy or
             myelosuppressive biological therapy and at least 1 week from the last dose of
             non-myelosuppressive biologic therapy.  Any questions related to the definition of
             non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Principal Investigator.

          -  No overt cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary or psychiatric disease.

               -  Exclusion Criteria

        3.2.1 Presence of metastatic disease for patients in Stratum A, B, D and E.  Patients with
        low grade gliomas (stratum C) may have tumor spread within the CNS.  Patients in Stratum F
        must have tumor spread within the CNS.

        3.2.2 Patients enrolled in Strata A and B may not have received any prior chemotherapy or
        anti-glioma therapy of any type other than radiation therapy (see 3.1.3)  Patients
        enrolled on stratum C must have received at least two prior chemotherapy or biologic
        therapy regimens and may not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of
        enrollment. Patients on Strata A, B, E, and F can not have received chemotherapy after
        radiation therapy was completed.

        3.2.3 Concurrent treatment or medications (must be off for at least 1 week) including:

          -  Interferon (e.g. Intron-A®)

          -  Allergy desensitization injections

          -  Growth factors (e.g. Procrit®, Aranesp®, Neulasta®)

          -  Interleukins (e.g. Proleukin®)

          -  Any investigational therapeutic medication

        3.2.4 Patients must not have a history of, or currently active autoimmune disorders
        requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral
        involvement.

        3.2.5 Use of immunosuppressives within four weeks prior to study entry or anticipated use
        of immunosuppressive agents.  Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used
        in the peri-operative period and/or during radiotherapy, must be tapered (no more than 0.1
        mg/kg/day, max 4 mg/day dexamethasone) for at least one week before study registration.
        Topical corticosteroids are acceptable.

        3.2.6 Patients with known addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs.

        3.2.7 Because patients with immune deficiency are not expected to respond to this therapy,
        HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study.

        3.3 Start of Treatment

        3.3.1 Patients must be registered prior to the start of treatment.

        3.3.2 The date protocol therapy is projected to start must be no later than 7 days after
        the date of study registration.
