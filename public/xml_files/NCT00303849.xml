      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, carboplatin, and melphalan, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells. Chemoprotective drugs, such as sodium thiosulfate, may protect normal
      cells from the side effects of chemotherapy. Blood-brain barrier disruption uses certain
      drugs, such as mannitol, to open the blood vessels around the brain and allow chemotherapy
      to be carried directly to the brain tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with
      blood-brain barrier disruption may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of melphalan when
      given together with etoposide, carboplatin and blood-brain barrier disruption followed by
      sodium thiosulfate and to see how well they work in treating patients with anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate toxicity and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of melphalan
           administered in conjunction with carboplatin and etoposide phosphate in combination
           with blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) with mannitol and delayed sodium
           thiosulfate, in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma. (phase
           I)

        -  Examine the efficacy, in terms of 1-year progression-free survival (1YPFS), in patients
           treated with this regimen. (phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the incidence of severe neutropenia (specifically febrile neutropenia or
           sepsis) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the overall toxicity of this regimen.

        -  Compare tumor response, 1YPFS, and survival in patients with vs without allelic loss of
           chromosomes 1p and 19q and p53 immunocytochemistry.

        -  Assess quality of life, cognitive function, and performance status in these patients.

        -  Estimate differences in 1YPFS between patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma and
           patients with oligoastrocytoma.

        -  Describe the role of biopsy versus extent of surgery (sub-maximal versus maximal safe
           resection) on 1YPFS and survival.

        -  Describe the role of prior radiotherapy on tumor response, 1YPFS, and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center, phase I dose-escalation study of melphalan followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive etoposide phosphate IV over 10 minutes, mannitol
           intra-arterially (IA), carboplatin IA over 10 minutes, and melphalan IA over 10 minutes
           on days 1 and 2 and sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes beginning 4 and 8 hours after
           completion of chemotherapy on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
           subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts
           recover OR a small dose of pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
           for up to 12 monthly courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive etoposide phosphate, mannitol, carboplatin, melphalan at the
           MTD, sodium thiosulfate, and G-CSF or pegfilgrastim as in phase I. Treatment repeats
           every 4 weeks for up to 12 monthly courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for one year;
      every 6 months for the next two years; then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
