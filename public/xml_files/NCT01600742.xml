  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vorinostat is a potent and well tolerated HDAC inhibitor. It has been reported to enhance
      radiosensitivity of cancer cells. We hypothesize that the addition of vorinostat to WBRT may
      increase therapeutic efficacy for patients with brain metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with
      brain metastases. Although WBRT yields high radiologic response rate (27~56%) and is
      effective in palliation of neurologic symptoms, the response duration is limited and
      neurologic progression remains the main cause of death in a significant number of patients.

      Vorinostat is reasonably well tolerated and there is also compelling evidence that
      vorinostat may serve as a radiosensitizer. Preclinical studies of HDAC inhibition have also
      shown efficacy in neuron protection. These data suggest that the addition of vorinostat to
      the standard therapy of WBRT may potentially increase their therapeutic efficacy without
      increasing neurotoxicity, and support the rationale of this phase II trial of vorinostat
      with WBRT in patients with brain metastases.
